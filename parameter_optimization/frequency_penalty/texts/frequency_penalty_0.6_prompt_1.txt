The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is a highly controversial and polarizing topic. Should the death sentence be implemented globally? Proponents of the death penalty argue that it deters crime and is just punishment for heinous crimes. Opponents argue that it violates human rights and may lead to the execution of innocent people. This essay argues against the implementation of the death sentence globally for several reasons.

The first reason to oppose a global implementation of the death penalty is that it violates human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly states that "Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person" (Article 3). State-sanctioned killing goes against this fundamental right, regardless of how terrible a crime might be. Furthermore, studies have shown that many countries with the death penalty have poor track records when it comes to upholding human rights in other areas.

Secondly, there is always a risk of executing innocent individuals. While many justice systems aim for complete accuracy and fairness in trials, mistakes can still happen. There have been multiple instances where people on death row were later exonerated through DNA evidence or other means. If these people had already been executed before their innocence was proven, there would be no way to undo the injustice done to them.

In addition to risking innocent lives, implementing the death sentence also perpetuates systemic inequalities in society based on race and class. Studies show that minorities and those who are economically disadvantaged are more likely to receive unfavorable treatment by law enforcement and prosecutors than their more affluent counterparts (Gross & Mauro 1457). If these biases permeate all aspects of the law enforcement process from investigation through trial, they may increase wrongful convictions resulting in unjust sentencing.

Lastly, proponents argue that capital punishment acts as an effective deterrent against crime but data suggest otherwise(Ackerman et al.). In fact, FBI data has repeatedly shown no correlation between states with higher executions per capita and lower homicide rates. Meanwhile, some countries, such as Canada and most of Europe have completely abolished the death penalty while maintaining low crime rates.

In conclusion, the death penalty is a topic that has been debated for centuries. However, global implementation is not an ideal solution to deter crime or address societal inequalities. It violates basic human rights, and there is always a risk of executing innocent people just as much as it targets minorities in societies that still hold deeply ingrained biases. The flaws inherent in capital punishment outweigh its supposed benefits. Instead, countries should focus on improving their justice systems â€” increasing equity and access to it while reducing the chance of errors or bias. Countries that have abolished the death penalty have managed to maintain low crime rates showing that other proven methods can be employed without violating fundamental rights to life.
