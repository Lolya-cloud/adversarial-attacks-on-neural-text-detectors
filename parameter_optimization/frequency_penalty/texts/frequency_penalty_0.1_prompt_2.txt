As society progresses, so should our attitudes towards inclusivity. Disabled people have long been neglected in public policy, and their lack of accessibility hinders their ability to participate in society fully. I firmly believe that the government has a moral obligation to do more to improve accessibility for the disabled community.

The government is responsible for ensuring that basic human rights are met for all citizens, including those with disabilities. After all, disability should not be a barrier to a fulfilling life. The government should provide increased accessibility to disabled individuals, enabling them to access education, jobs, and public spaces. Ironically, the disabled community is the most underserved when it comes to accessibility in public spaces, schools, and even healthcare facilities. This must change.

For years, people with disabilities have been confined to their homes since public spaces were not created or modified for them. As a result of that, they struggled to remain active members of their communities and faced social isolation. Public transportation systems should be comfortable in accommodating individuals with disabilities. They should be able to travel as quickly and conveniently as everyone else. By making these small changes, we can enable disabled individuals to explore new communities without having to compromise their safety.

Through appropriate training and accommodating individuals with the right equipment, people with disabilities can work and contribute to society. When the workplace is designed in a way that facilitates access for people with physical disabilities, the disabled workforce can contribute significantly. It is unacceptable that disabled individuals should be unemployed because the job site is inaccessible.

Furthermore, schools can create an environment where students of all abilities can succeed, but only if accessibility is made a priority. To be an all-inclusive organization, schools must be designed in such a way that students with disabilities have access to all aspects of the curriculum. When a school's design fosters accessibility, students with disabilities can thrive academically, socially, and holistically.

It is government's responsibility to cater to the needs of all individuals within the community, including those with physical disabilities. By doing so, we can reduce the number of people who are restricted to their homes due to a lack of accessibility. The government can motivate the private sector to take action by creating an environment that encourages businesses to cater to those with disabilities. Additionally, governments must promote a culture of inclusion by developing campaigns that raise awareness and celebration of the disabled community.

In conclusion, greater accessibility for disabled persons is not just a matter of practicality; it is a question of social equality and human decency. It is the government's responsibility to do more in terms of ensuring that all citizens are granted the access they require, regardless of their abilities. This includes but it is not limited to, public spaces, workplaces, and educational institutions. By doing so, we can build a country where everyone has equal opportunities. Accommodations for those with physical disabilities benefits everyone, and it is high time the government took responsibility.
