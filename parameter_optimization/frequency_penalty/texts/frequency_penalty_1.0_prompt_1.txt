The decision to implement the death penalty is a contentious one, riddled with moral and practical concerns. While some believe it serves as a just punishment for heinous crimes, others argue that it is a cruel and inhumane practice that fails to address the root causes of crime. Despite the ongoing debate surrounding this issue, there are compelling reasons why the death sentence should not be implemented globally.

Firstly, there is no evidence that shows that capital punishment effectively deters crime any more than other forms of punishment such as life imprisonment. A significant number of studies have shown that there is little difference in crime rates between countries where the death penalty has been abolished and those where it still exists. In fact, areas with higher murder rates are generally more likely to have capital punishment laws. This suggests a correlation between high levels of violence and harsh sentencing rather than causation which doesn't support the argument for implementing the death sentence globally.

Secondly, capital punishment offers no opportunity for redemption or rehabilitation which can be detrimental to society as a whole. There are scenarios wherein offenders may reform after their conviction or develop new evidence exonerating them from guilt even though they were sentenced initially by mistake without proper due process or adequate counsel at their trial thereby putting innocent people at risk of losing their lives unjustly; these circumstances highlight how final and irreversible execution abolishes any chance an individual has for redemption or exoneration leading to unnecessary loss of life.

Thirdly, there exist flaws in both legal systems and human nature that make implementing global execution difficult if not impossible without errors made either deliberately often through corruption or unintentionally through mistakes caused by human error within judicial processes. No matter how foolproof governments believe they can make their system for pursuing capital justice becomes ineffective when injustices are overlooked, leading inevitably toward an inherent bias against specific groups like racial minorities serving on juries face similar disadvantages every day since studies show many white jurors tend  favor execution over imprisonment for Black defendants. This undermines the integrity of the legal system, causing people to lose faith in justice and the idea that it serves to penalize only those who are guilty of heinous offences.

In conclusion, implementing capital punishment on a global scale is a controversial issue that should be approached with extreme caution. The argument that it deters crime has little research or historical evidence supporting its effectiveness and therefore is not compelling enough to justify risking innocent lives like against flawed legal systems driven by corrupt/judgments often determined by racial profiling or jury bias etc.. Instead we must collectively seek alternative solutions such as investing resources into providing adequate education within communities and repairing broken social safety nets  causing criminal behavior resulting in violence rather than execute individuals â€“ often times unfairly- under our flawed justice system which studies show does more harm overall than good towards societal needs in addressing serious criminal offenses worldwide.
