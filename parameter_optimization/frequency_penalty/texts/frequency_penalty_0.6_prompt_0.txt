In today's world, educational institutions are becoming more flexible and adaptive to cater students' needs and interests. One area where this flexibility could be explored more is curating the high school curriculum. Students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum because it will provide them with a platform to explore their passions, increase creativity and engagement, and make learning relevant.

Firstly, allowing students to shape their high school curriculum would enable them to customize it based on their preferences and interests. The traditional system of education has a predetermined set of courses that every student must take regardless of whether they have an interest in the subject or not. Allowing them to choose which subjects they want to study will result in better engagement from the students since they'll be more interested in what they're learning.

Secondly, this method provides learners with opportunities to excel not only academically but also personally. When a student has an interest in a topic or subject, they're motivated to adapt and learn more about it independently. As such, being able to tailor-make their curriculum would allow them as individuals who have unique abilities, experiences, goals, and dreams.

Furthermore, introducing diversity into education can foster inventiveness and curiosity among learners leading to improved collaborative work practices. By allowing the students some degree of autonomy over what subjects are taught within their curriculum gives them space for new ideas hence making learning relatable thus producing better academic results.

Finally, curation would help reduce the reliance on standardized testing for evaluation purposes since each student has different interests that cannot be tested under a one-size-fits-all exam format. Such testing focuses mostly on assessment criteria that do not take into account individuality hence limiting growth potential across genders or races even though such limitations may not necessarily reflect the ability of an individual.

Opponents may argue that allowing students freedom with regards to curriculum selection could impede preparation for different career paths. However studying diverse subjects apart from those altogether with their career direct paths gives them a holistic perspective of the world and the different necessary skill sets required in today's workplace. Therefore, such a criticism only emphasizes the importance of providing broader education options for learners, which they can explore based on what resonates with their interests more meaningfully.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is the way to go as it presents infinite possibilities for individuals to build upon what they know and enjoy while expanding their knowledgebase. It allows learners to prioritize personal growth over grades with personalized learning per learner over group-focused delivery as school educators will now have more choices aside from one size fits all planning of syllabi.
