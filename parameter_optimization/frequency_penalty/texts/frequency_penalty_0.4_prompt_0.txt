Education is a central pillar that holds our society together. It is the foundation on which we build our future and prepare ourselves for the workforce. For decades, schools have followed a rigid, standardized curriculum that emphasizes memorization and rote learning over critical thinking and creativity. However, with the rise in technology and the need for innovative solutions, it is time for schools to reevaluate their curriculum offerings to suit the needs of individual students. Therefore, school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, students have different learning styles and interests that are better suited to specific subjects. Some may excel in science and math, while others may be more inclined towards arts or humanities. By giving students control over their curriculum, they can choose courses that align with their interests and aspirations, leading to greater engagement in the learning process.

Furthermore, providing students with educational freedom empowers them to take responsibility for their education. With this approach, schools can inspire intrinsic motivation in learners by giving them the opportunity to design a curriculum based on what they believe will develop their skills and knowledge most effectively. Additionally, this approach reinforces learners' capacity for self-directed learning.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum provides them with exposure to new ideas and experiences outside of the traditional classroom setting. This exposure can broaden the minds of students who come from different backgrounds or cultural experiences. The freedom allows these individuals to learn about other cultures' perspectives directly from those who live within them.

However it is essential to note that this approach would require a complex system of guidance and support from teachers throughout the process. Underqualified or undertrained instructors might struggle to provide effective guidance when faced with a diverse array of possible courses across multiple grades.

Additionally, designing one's identical high school description takes significant effort from learners who must rely on pre-existing course outlines without formal training or coursework design experience.

Finally but not least important is considering how colleges or universities evaluate academic performance and the impact of variations in coursework on those evaluations. With increased control over the curriculum, students may become tempted to bias their academic decisions toward courses that are perceived as easier or which might increase their overall grade point average.

In conclusion, education should be a liberating experience that empowers young adults to prepare for their future roles in society, and there is a need for our schools to occupy a hip position around educating them. As such, providing students with the opportunity to choose and curate their high school curriculum prepares them for a future full of unknown challenges. In the end, it provides ideal preparation for higher learning while also yielding young adults ready to tackle the challenges invariably found in our global economy.
