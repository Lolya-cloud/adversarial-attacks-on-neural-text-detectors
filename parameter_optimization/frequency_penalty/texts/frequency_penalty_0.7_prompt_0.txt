In today's educational system, high school students are given a narrow range of curriculum options to choose from. This one-size-fits-all approach does not cater to individual interests and passions. Therefore, it is important to consider the idea of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum.

The first reason why students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is that it enables them to pursue their passions and interests. Every student has a unique talent or hobby that they might want to explore in greater depth during their academic journey. However, the current system does not allow such flexibility as students are required to take courses which do not fit with their interests or goals. Allowing the freedom for students to select courses that align with their strengths and talents not only increases academic performance, but will help them discover career choices that they may have otherwise overlooked.

Another reason why students should have the opportunity to curate their own high school curriculum is because it fosters independence, self-awareness and responsibility in teenagers. High schools which allows academic freedom inspire Creativity among youth regarding topics that interest them in modern society and don't limit them based on subjects required by academia. This inspiration motivates generations of future leaders called into this more-modern age of innovation.

Furthermore, allowing individual expression within a curriculum also encourages risk-taking behaviors in academics as well as personal endeavors outside of the classroom with new confidence so young adults can form healthier relationships with themselves and peers alike creating resilience early on for life-long growth opportunities.

One could argue that allowing high school students to choose their own curriculum would result in an inadequate understanding of certain critical subjects resulting in graduation rates plummeting as well as college preparedness lacking vital prerequisites necessary towards higher education success often leading towards mental health challenges amongst many adolescents during this crucial time.

However, these issues can easily be solved through careful planning strategies including having mandatory core classes and year-round counseling programs assisting youths who struggle academically, mentally or socially.

In conclusion, allowing high school students the freedom to curate their own academic journey is a positive approach which benefits these teens in all aspects of development. This system could create exciting opportunities for our future generations creating a more innovative academic education for many years to come. The role of today's educational system is essential for building tomorrow's crop of innovators and leaders, and curation of a high school curriculum is a step towards progression in the right direction.
