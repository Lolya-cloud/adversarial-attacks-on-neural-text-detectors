Introduction:
The death sentence is the most extreme form of punishment a person can receive, and it has been a subject of debate for decades. Many countries have already abolished it, while others continue to implement it. The question arises whether the implementation of the death sentence should be globally accepted or not?

Body:
It is argued that implementing the death sentence globally would reduce crime rates. Supporters believe that if people know that they will face execution for their crimes, they will think twice before committing them. It will deter criminals and make them realize the consequences of their actions.

However, on closer examination, this argument doesn't hold much weight. There are no reliable statistics to support this claim. Furthermore, executing offenders directly violates their human rights and dignity.

The implementation of the death sentence also raises ethical concerns. Innocent people are often wrongly convicted and sentenced to death. Executing innocent individuals is an inhumane act that cannot be reversed once done.

Another argument against the global implementation of the death penalty is that it disproportionately targets vulnerable groups such as minorities and low-income populations. Studies have shown that those without access to quality legal services or those who belong to marginalized communities are at higher risk of wrongful conviction.

Additionally, some argue that capital punishment does not provide closure or justice for victims' families as initially thought out since executions are merely revenge-like acts instead of restorative justice efforts designed to provide true exoneration through accountability accountability more constructively driven by circumstances beyond just punitive measures as 'punishment should fit crime'.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, there are various arguments both in favor of and against implementing the death penalty worldwide.. Although supporters may justify capital punishment with deterrence factors cited via previous mentioned statistical research; It would be inhumane to carry out such a punishment while disregarding our basic human right-that being life itself at any cost--especially when all potentialities point towards irreversibly wronged individuals who may bear no charges in the first place. The only humane way to treat this issue is to get rid of capital punishment altogether and re-examine how we approach justice, especially within vulnerable marginalized communities that suffer from bias and unjust practices - as they are currently among the most at risk-groups of receiving unfair convictions and sentences.
