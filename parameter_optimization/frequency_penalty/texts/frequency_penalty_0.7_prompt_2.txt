In many countries around the world, people with physical disabilities often face a great deal of obstacles and hurdles when it comes to access. These range from uneven pavements, inaccessible public transportation systems, and buildings that lack the necessary features. There is much debate about whether the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities. In this essay, I will argue that governments have a moral duty to improve accessibility for people with disabilities.

The first reason why governments should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities is that it is their right as citizens of the country. People have the right to basic amenities provided by their government. For individuals with disabilities who may find it difficult to navigate through various parts or areas in the country because of certain impairments or conditions, providing functional aids such as wheelchair ramps or accessible public transportations are among several ways by which governments could enhance their accessibility and enable them to enjoy these rights without barriers.

Additionally, improving accessibility would offer a wide range of benefits not only in terms of individual welfare but also social and economic development. More availability of wheelchair ramps or lifts in commercial buildings would help more individuals enter into the workforce; additionally, they can increase patronage within business premises by persons with disabilities The newly created scope for individuals will accelerate society’s moving forward and development.A desireable consequence?

Moreover,governments can reduce medical costs.Otherwise healthy individuals who happen to be disabled but prevented by present barriers from accessing certain hospital departments may be forced get hospitalized under different sections where treatment fees cost more.

Opponents may argue that improvements can certainly be made available for those seeking them; after all,it cannot go ignored that average able-bodied citizens are far greater in number than disabled members of society where improvement demand might be limited.Against this,I agree that numbers matter,but this logic is flawed because smaller section's needs shouldn't go ignored.Some may argue government's obligations doesn't lay in providing ‘special facilities’ to few members of society. In response, I would argue that governments have the moral responsibility to foster a more comprehensive and integrated society where all individuals have access.So,the government’s obligation is not to provide ‘special’ or exceptions. Instead, the government should focus on levelling the playing field so that people with physical disabilities have an equal chance at achieving a comfortable quality of life.

In conclusion,governments across the world need to get more involved in improving access for persons with disabilities.While there may be financial considerations and a few other unforeseen issues in enhancing accessibility; they are usually outnumbered by social benefits.Individuals with physical disabilities deserve equal opportunities,and improving access is vital for their ability to fulfill these rights.
