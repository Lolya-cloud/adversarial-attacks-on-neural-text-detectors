The death sentence or capital punishment has been a controversial issue since ancient times. It refers to the legal process in which a person is sentenced to death by the state as a punishment for committing heinous crimes such as murder, treason, and terrorism. In recent years, the use of the death sentence has been abolished in several countries due to various reasons such as ethical concerns and human rights violations. However, some argue that implementing the death sentence globally will provide deterrence against crimes and guarantee justice for victims’ families who have suffered loss.

One of the primary reasons why some people argue for the implementation of the death sentence globally is that it provides deterrence against crimes. Proponents argue that criminals are likely to think twice before committing crimes knowing they could face capital punishment if they get caught. A study conducted by the University of Colorado found that states with higher execution rates had lower crime rates, proving that capital punishment acts as a deterrent.

Another reason why some argue for the implementation of capital punishment globally is that it provides justice for victims’ families. The families of victims who have been brutally murdered or raped often experience traumatic events and long-term psychological impacts. The implementation of capital punishment provides closure to these families and ensures justice is served.

However, despite these arguments, there are several reasons why implementing capital punishment globally should be avoided. Firstly, it goes against human rights principles, which value life over all else. Capital punishment is not only inhumane but also violates individuals’ basic human rights such as their right to life and freedom from torture.

Moreover, implementing capital punishment globally has no scientific evidence that it deters crime rates; in fact, countries with no death sentences have lower crime rates than countries which use it frequently. Multiple studies have shown that other factors such as socioeconomic status and education levels play a more significant role in reducing crime rates than using capital punishment.

Additionally, the judicial system is not immune to human error; innocent people have been sentenced to death and subsequently found to be innocent. The application of the death sentence puts innocent lives at risk, and it is irreversible if a mistake is made.

In conclusion, although the implementation of the death sentence may seem like a justifiable solution for some, it should not be implemented globally. It goes against basic human rights principles by valuing life less while providing no scientific evidence that it deters crime rates. The judicial system is also not immune to human error; innocent people have been killed in the past because of wrongful sentencing. There are alternative solutions that focus on prevention, rehabilitation and education to reduce crime rates rather than retribution, which puts vulnerable communities at risk. Therefore, countries should prioritize human rights over outdated justifications and abolish capital punishment globally.
