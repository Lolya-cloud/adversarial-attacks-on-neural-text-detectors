The current educational system constructs a standardized curriculum for all high school students, with little if any input from students themselves. However, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? I argue that it is in their best interests to do so. The benefits of providing opportunities for students to shape their high school education are increasingly recognized by educators, policymakers, and young people across the world.

Firstly, enabling students to co-design what they learn promotes a sense of ownership over their education. By curating their curriculum, students are likely to be more engaged and committed to their studies. As a result, they are likely to be more ambitious in their goals, putting in extra effort and committing themselves to learning more about what matters most to them. They also grow in independence and can take responsibility for ensuring that education meets their needs in meaningful ways.

Secondly, when students have the chance to design their own curriculum, they are better equipped for the future. In an age of automation and digitization, the ability to learn independently and adapt swiftly is vital. Personalizing learning is an efficient way of training young people to embrace flexible learning techniques, which are increasingly essential in modern society. When empowered with selecting the curriculum that interests them most, learners can use this opportunity to focus on areas that they are genuinely passionate about and follow unique educational paths that cater to their career aspirations.

Thirdly, offering more flexibility when it comes to the high school curriculum may also reduce stress levels among students. There is growing evidence that overburdening students with restricted outcomes and limiting individual freedom may exacerbate anxiety among young people. Providing scope for individualized learning paths can help students manage their workloads more effectively while ensuring that teaching staff remain on hand to provide support.

Last but not least, letting students curate their high school education makes teaching more exciting and rewarding for educators. It gives teachers a chance to explore new areas and personalize subjects in more meaningful ways, something that can enrich the learning experience for both learners and educators.

In summary, permitting students to craft particular elements of their high school curriculum can result in better academic outcomes, support young people in their future endeavors, and diminish anxiety levels among teachers. The current one-size-fits-all educational pattern no longer caters to the unique needs and talents of our young people in today's fast-paced world. Instead, it is vital that we explore innovative, fresh approaches that collaborate with learners to harness their motivation and enthusiasm for education. For these reasons, students should be given a voice when it comes to designing their high school curricula.
