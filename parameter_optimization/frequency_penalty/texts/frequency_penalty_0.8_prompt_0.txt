In today’s day and age, there is a growing demand for students to have more control over their education. One aspect of this is the ability for high school students to curate their own curriculum. I strongly believe that students should be allowed to curate parts of their high school curriculum, as it will help them become more engaged and motivated in their education.

Firstly, allowing students to curate part of their high school curriculum will give them a sense of ownership over their education. Currently, many students feel as though they are just going through the motions in the classroom and that what they learn does not apply to their individual interests or future goals. By giving them some say in what they are learning, they can take ownership of what is being taught and connect it better with their unique interests.

Secondly, allowing for student curation will make high school more engaging and relevant for them. A majority of high schoolers tend to disengage from learning because it seems irrelevant or boring to them. If they are able to choose certain topics or subjects within the broader curriculum that interest them most – such as environmentalism or entrepreneurship – it can spur curiosity and motivate them further than a standardized educational model could.

Moreover, student-led curriculums can cater better towards current events which might go ignored otherwise due do bureaucratic red tape. They can take into account data collection mechanisms without political agendas driving policy implementation; cover taboo topics like racism without creating havoc in specific communities; widening understanding on mental health issues facing teenagers via shared experiences important enough for open dialogue but not dominating an entire semester-long subject matter which could balance out both relevance among young adults peers while having enough substance about emotional management techniques thorough interaction with experts such as psychological counselors who know how best deal with those issues affecting adolescent growth.

However, opponents may argue that students lack the maturity required for making responsible decisions regarding academic selection: either being too incompetent or irresponsible when selecting courses crucial for their forthcoming livelihood when deferring beyond personal interests. It requires a teacher or academic adviser with different perspectives advising students that reflect reality that they are educated and able to apply critical thinking skills in the choices they make. For instance, a student who specializes only in arts subjects might find it challenging to get meaningful career paths, and may require external advice pushing her to start planning her life along more practical lines.

In conclusion, allowing high school students more flexibility in the courses they take can be beneficial for several reasons. By giving them some agency over their education, students can feel more motivated and invested in their learning process. Importing broader socio-political challenges which might stir controversy without overshadowing general student appeal makes school curriculum under those circumstances more engaging; hence opening multiple channels of interaction between young minds from varied backgrounds contributing towards making education memorable again whilst meeting personal interests complemented with sound professional life foundations.
