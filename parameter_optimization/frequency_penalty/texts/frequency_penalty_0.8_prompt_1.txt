The death sentence, also known as capital punishment, has been a highly debated topic for many decades. Some argue that it is an effective deterrent to crime, while others deem it as a cruel and inhumane form of punishment. This essay will argue that the death sentence should not be implemented globally due to its moral implications and the risk of executing innocent individuals.

One of the primary issues with implementing the death sentence globally is its moral implications. Preserving life is considered a fundamental human right in most societies, and the intentional killing of an individual can have lasting psychological effects on those involved and their families. Moreover, many view capital punishment as morally inconsistent with common ethical principles such as non-maleficence and justice.

Furthermore, implementing the death sentence globally presents a risk of executing innocent individuals. The justice system is fallible, which means wrongful convictions are inevitable. According to Amnesty International (2021), at least 3% of those sentenced to death worldwide are believed to be wrongly convicted. Many countries lack adequate legal representation for indigent defendants or have corrupt judicial systems that allow for incorrect rulings or blatant corruption.

Moreover, even if someone’s guilt were beyond doubt when they received their conviction, advancements in forensic science often prove old evidence inaccurate or misleading long after trials take place(ACLU). These risks create an unfair situation wherein innocent people could be sentenced to die at the hands of their government; this level of injustice is not acceptable under any circumstances.

There is also significant evidence that suggests that capital punishment does not achieve its intended goal – deterring crime (Hassan 2016). This lack of deterrent effect may result from cultural acceptance among individuals inclined towards criminal activities that they could get away with crimes if they haven't been caught before joining radical groups like ISIS or Al-Qaeda.

Lastly, implementing capital punishment globally can harm relations between nations by perpetuating violence rather than paving the way for restorative justice measures such as reconciliation and de-escalation. Global policymakers must seek alternative forms of punishment that preserve human rights and aim to restore justice, rather than emphasizing punitive measures alone.

In conclusion, the death sentence should not be implemented globally because it is morally inconsistent with principles of human life preservation, raises risks of executing innocent individuals, does not deter crime effectively, challenges international relations, and there are more humane ways to deal with criminals. It is essential to advocate for unbiased judicial systems that promote fairness and justice for all over violent or barbaric systems that prioritize retribution above restoration. While the elimination of capital punishment may require substantial political upheaval in some nations or resistance against pressure from global superpowers such as China or Russia who still rely heavily on capital punishment sentences to punish public enemies criticizing their regimes from a distance because every life deserves fair treatment.
