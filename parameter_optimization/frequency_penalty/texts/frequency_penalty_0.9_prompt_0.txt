The concept of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum is a debatable one. While some argue that it can promote individualized learning and boost students' engagement with the material, others believe that it can lead to an unequal distribution of educational resources and undermine certain subjects' importance. After careful consideration, I believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the most significant advantages of allowing students to choose their courses is promoting individualized learning. The current standardized model often fails many students since it overlooks their different preferences, talents, and skills. By giving them the power to select from a wide range of courses tailored to their interests or career aspirations, they are more likely to be highly motivated and engaged in learning about what they care about. According to a study conducted by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center in 2018, college entrants who had taken more rigorous courses in high school were not only more likely but also tend to have higher GPAs than peers who took less rigorous courses.

Furthermore, letting learners pick courses themselves allows them greater control over developing new knowledge-seeking ventures outside traditional disciplines. Since there are limited subject options for every grade level due to constraints like classroom size and teacher availability for some subjects, schools will always find it challenging balancing out the different needs for simultaneous learners effectively. With student-curated classes taking place only when classes are needed beyond conventional disciplines offered by schools themselves (computers programming or art history), learners have space for creativity in picking activities that create personalized innovation spaces supportive of diverse communities.

In contrast, opponents argue against allowing studentsâ€™ selection due primarily because curating lessons risks creating inequality among education levels and exposing other studies as unimportant leading up towards college admissions or entry into other workforce fields requiring certain preliminary skills not related directly back into proficient analysis via intellectual curiosity (e.g., mathematics required strongly fulfilled before legitimately qualifying as an engineer). Their fear is that these choices will subsequently impact students' career prospects and earning potential after finishing high school. Counteracting such fears through detailed policies ensuring all subjects of study offer some way to culminate in a professional pathway towards graduating high school proved of immense importance as it balances more options beyond the norm, such as vocational training programs or interdisciplinary partnerships.

In summary, while allowing students to select courses may have its downsides, the benefits far outweigh them. As individuals success has been shown to be influenced heavily by factors such as self-motivation. Inevitably, having participants able to participate actively in learning rather than passively receiving knowledge is necessary for instilling essential skills required in navigating diverse and ever-changing global workplaces with an interdisciplinary mindset that promotes inventive thinking while balancing industrial and societal needs. Consequently, we should embrace this new customized education system by implementing it across various high schools with clear guidelines outlining what subjects long-term benefits learners towards desirable post-high school careers rightfully considered seriously during academic advising sessions held throughout each semester's registration period.
