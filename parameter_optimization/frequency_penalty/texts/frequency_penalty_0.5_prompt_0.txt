The debate on whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is highly controversial. Proponents argue that allowing students to curate their curriculum gives them more freedom, autonomy, and responsibility in their academic journey. Opponents, on the other hand, argue that such freedom can lead to a lack of rigor and academic preparation.

One of the major arguments in favor of student-curated curriculum is that it empowers students to take responsibility for their learning. Students can customize their curriculum based on their interests and learning styles. These individuals are in the best position to determine what they want to learn about and how they want to learn it. Such flexibility can motivate students and increase engagement with the material being taught. A recent study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that students who had more say in selecting courses were more engaged in class, attended school more frequently, and had an increased sense of purpose.

Another persuasive reason for allowing student-curated curriculums is that it encourages critical thinking skills. Students who have an active role in selecting what they study are more likely to be curious about subjects and develop a greater interest in inquiry, research, and knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, choosing coursework reinforces valuable life skills like decision-making, planning strategies, goal-setting and time-management abilities which are essential for future success.

However, opponents contend that student-curated curriculums may diminish academic rigor or create gaps in education standards. Without proper guidance from certified educators who have a comprehensive know-how on how each course works in collaboration with one another across years, students may pick certain courses only because they feel 'easy' or they have less workload instead of taking courses that challenge them academically which could lead inadequate preparation for college or further education.

Moreover, some believe that giving too much freedom can lead some students toward specialized instruction lines which could reduce the diversity of knowledge in general subjects (such as math or English) that all students should know. This implies missing fundamentals that serve as building blocks for future education/careers.

In conclusion, it is irrefutable that student-curated curriculums come with its own sets of benefits and challenges. However, it is essential to support them with appropriate guidance from certified educators to ensure proper preparation for college and career success. Regardless of the benefits it provides, we must balance student autonomy with a comprehensive educational experience that ensures they have the skills needed for their future. In our digital era, it is critical to equip students with necessary skills-both academic and metacognitive-to succeed in secondary education and beyond--and this can only be done through competent implementation policies for student-curated curriculums.
