In the world we live in today, most people are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of education that their children receive. Some students may feel that the current curriculum offered in schools is limited and not relevant to their personal interests or career aspirations. This is why there has been a growing demand for students' ability to curate their own high school curriculum.

One of the main reasons why students should be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum is because it can lead to better academic performance. Often times, when students have the freedom to choose subjects that are interesting and personally relevant, they become more motivated and engaged in their studies. This drives them towards developing strong learning habits, which ultimately leads to better academic outcomes.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help them prepare for future careers as well as help teachers identify where they may need additional support. In fact, having an opportunity for personalized learning ensures that each student gets proper instruction based on his or her individual needs and interests.

Another advantage brought about by this idea is increased creativity amongst young minds. By giving them choices such as selecting different areas of study beyond what's currently offered with less bureaucracy would enable innovation among our youth.

Critics may argue against allowing students control over selecting courses because some areas such as mathematics and sciences require certain prerequisites before following an advanced path; however if done effectively with guidance from educators who advise these individuals separately then they stand a higher chance of success compared those only opting into "fun" classes rather than objective planning around career prospects when selecting course options while still maintaining required core modules.

However despite possible opposition against this policy change in favor of mandated subjects within specific stages such as freshman year classrooms may see some enhancement with new class offerings while keeping core structure intact through junior level schooling after which senior years could be more flexible under strict guidance so there's more options without sacrificing necessary skills foundations mandatory pre-college preparation that contributes significantly towards scholarship eligibility, admissions letters and better SAT/ACT scores.

Ultimately, it is a question of whether or not we want to empower our students with the freedom to choose subjects for themselves. Sure there's a possibility of more logistical matters such as class scheduling or fees beyond core modules, but those issues are constantly being used as red herrings by individuals who oppose such major reforms. We should always be open-minded and willing to try innovative thoughts within centers of innovation - our schools before measuring any possible unforeseen consequences over benefits; this will go a long way in enhancing learners with varied interests while preparing them for success beyond academics. Thus it can be concluded that allowing high school students control over their curriculums would positively impact areas such as academia, time management skills alongside increased creativity making it worthwhile policy reform worth considering at the highest level of educational institutional structures.
