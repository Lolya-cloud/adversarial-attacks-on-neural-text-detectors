Accessibility is a fundamental right for all human beings, regardless of their physical abilities. However, people with disabilities often face barriers in accessing buildings, transportation, and other services due to a lack of accommodations. Although the government has made some strides towards improving accessibility in recent years, more needs to be done to ensure that people with physical disabilities can live full and productive lives.

One of the primary reasons why the government should do more to improve accessibility is because it is required by law. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was enacted in 1990 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination and ensure equal access to public services. However, many buildings and structures were built before this law was put into place; therefore retrofitting them with necessary accommodations can be costly. In addition, some businesses are still not complying fully with the ADA's requirements today.

Another reason why the government should do more is that improving accessibility for people with disabilities has numerous benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. People with disabilities who have better access to education, employment opportunities, healthcare facilities as well as public spaces like parks & tourist destinations can contribute better towards nation building .

Moreover, implementing accessible transportation options like buses or trains ensures that individuals can travel independently without relying on family or friends for transportation assistance; which ultimately provides greater independence and freedom.

In addition, taking steps to improve accessibility is also economically beneficial. According to a study conducted by The Center for Global Policy Solutions (CGPS), over 20% of America's working-age population have some form of disability; this translates into about $1 trillion dollars annually in disposable income - however businesses who don't provide accessible options will miss out on attracting these customers . If accessibility improvements significantly increase consumer demand it could potentially create job opportunities too!

However there are also counterarguments suggesting that private solutions will suffice , but voluntary actions by private institutions can rarely ever guarantee consistent results due differing policies based purely on profit-making from business to business.

In conclusion, the government has a moral obligation to ensure that all citizens have equal access to public services and spaces regardless of disability. Increasing accessibility should not be considered a luxury; rather, it is an essential service that promotes inclusion and equality within society for everyone. Further investment in measures that improve accessibility will create economic benefits and demonstrate the government's commitment towards successfully addressing social injustices; therefore more needs to be done by the government beyond legal mandates to create a truly equitable society.
