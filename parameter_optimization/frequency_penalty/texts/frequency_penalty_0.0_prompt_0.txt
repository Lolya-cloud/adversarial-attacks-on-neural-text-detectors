Education is an important aspect of life as it shapes and prepares individuals for the future. However, the traditional approach to education may not always cater to the needs and interests of every student. Many high school students feel limited by their school curriculum, which is structured to meet general educational needs, rather than their specific career or interest goals. Therefore, there is a growing need to question whether students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, every student has unique goals, interests, and aspirations for the future. A one-size-fits-all approach to education may not align with their individual needs. The education system should accommodate the interests of students and allow them to tailor their learning to their specific areas of interest. For example, a student who is interested in computer graphics may not find traditional art and design courses as engaging as courses with a computer graphics focus. Such cases can result in low motivation and performance in class leading to a lack of interest in an area of study.

Secondly, students who are allowed to create their own curriculum will be more invested in their education, and learning experiences will be more relevant to their interests. Every student has different learning preferences that can impact how well they understand, retain, and apply new information. Therefore, when students learn topics that they are interested in, their motivation to understand the subject matter will significantly increase. They are more open to exploring additional knowledge that accompanies their area of interest. This approach will help to increase their overall knowledge base and reduce the number of students who feel that topics are irrelevant or pointless.

Thirdly, students who create their own curriculum have an opportunity to explore their talents and acquire early practical skills. It also allows students to identify their weaknesses in specific areas. Allowing students to choose their courses early helps them to better plan and prepare for their future careers by learning practical skills. Students with these skills are better equipped to gain hands-on experience, develop practical work experience, and stand out in the competitive job market.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum to meet their unique interests and goals. This form of personalized learning will not only improve engagement and motivation, but also provide the students with opportunities to acquire practical skills, manage their weak areas, and lead to better career prospects in the future. By allowing the students to have an active role in their own education, it allows them to gain deeper insight into subjects that interests them the most. As a result, students are more likely to become passionate and successful individuals, capable of achieving their goals and aspirations.
