Physical disabilities are present in many individuals across the globe. From birth defects and accidents to ailments that develop as one ages, physical disabilities can make everyday life challenging. However, there is no doubt that a lack of accessibility can further exacerbate such issues. As a result, it is critical for governments to take proactive action to ensure that people with physical disabilities have equal access to essential services and facilities.

Firstly, accessibility is a fundamental right of human beings regardless of their physical ability. People with disabilities require the same opportunities and access to public amenities as able-bodied individuals. Many of the structures and infrastructure we use today were not designed intentionally for people with physical impairments. Therefore, by improving accessibility standards, governments would be fulfilling their obligations under The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People With Disabilities and creating equal opportunities for all citizens.

Furthermore, improving access for people with physical disabilities can provide enormous benefits to society as a whole. For example, increasing awareness around accessibility issues could lead towards innovation for universal design principles so that housing, public transportation, and workplaces are tailored towards accommodating everyone’s needs without discrimination. In this way, both people with disabilities and able-bodied individuals will be able to interact meaningfully within public space – thus enabling social inclusion.

However, although many countries have made considerable efforts towards promoting accessibility standards in their legislation, it has often remained an overlooked aspect of policymaking in practice. Many buildings remain inaccessible due to lack of elevators or ramps; wheelchairs cannot be utilized while riding on public transportation due to the absence of designated spaces or lifts; while services such as healthcare inadequately provided for physical disabilities - making daily life all the more difficult.

Moreover, poor access standards create enormous economic implications. Approximately 15 percent of the world's population are classified as disable persons – billions who potentially find themselves excluded from employment or unable to start entrepreneurial ventures due to low investment in accessible infrastructure - This is an issue which continues to stymie progress in many countries.

Finally, there is a moral imperative to do more for people with disabilities. Accessibility allows those with physical impairments the same opportunities and life experiences as the able-bodied – it would seem heartless not to support accessibility improvement measures.

In conclusion, accessibility should be a crucial aspect of government policy. All members of society – regardless of their physical abilities – should have equal access to public goods that are available to able-bodied individuals. The economic, social, and moral case for improving accessibility standards is compelling, and there is much that needs to be done by governments worldwide. In doing so, one hopes that we will continue towards a world inclusive of all individuals - irrespective of their physical ability or disabilities, ensuring that everyone sings the chorus: "Nothing about us without us."
