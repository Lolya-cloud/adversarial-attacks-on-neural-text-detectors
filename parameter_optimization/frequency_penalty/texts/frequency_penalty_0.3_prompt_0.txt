Education is an essential tool for all individuals who strive to be progressive and productive members of society. However, there is a growing concern on how schools can best provide learning opportunities that meet the diverse needs of their students. One idea that has gained momentum is the suggestion that high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. While this idea may seem radical to some, I strongly agree that it is necessary.

Firstly, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum would empower them to pursue their interests and passions. Often, the traditional curriculum only offers a limited range of subjects leaving students struggling with the classes they are not interested in. When students are allowed to choose topics they are passionate about, they become more interested, inspired, and motivated. Moreover, they will be willing to spend more time learning and developing their skills on those topics.

Secondly, students will have ownership of the education experience. With a curated curriculum, students will be able to take full control of their education and have faculty support along the way. Students will become proactive in creating an individualized pathway specific to their future goals, ultimately giving them a sense of accomplishment and confidence in themselves. A student's ability to take control of a portion of their learning experience creates accountability as well as an overall positive attitude towards education.

Thirdly, this approach also has the potential to help educators improve the quality and relevance of high school curricula. When educators understand the true interests and abilities of their students through student-led curation, they can personalize instruction and add beneficial activities accordingly. Curriculum planners can determine whether or not a set curriculum matches up with student’s interests or if certain activities can be added for further depth of knowledge.

However, detractors argue that allowing high school students to curate their curriculum would lead to inadequate coverage on some key subjects required for college entrance exams- but that is not entirely true. Students can create a balanced program plan with assistance from teachers and counselors, which takes into consideration college entrance requirements. They can also be taught how to use and ensure the comprehensive knowledge they need, leading to exceptional preparedness for the challenges of university-level studies that require individuals of diverse backgrounds.

In conclusion, giving high school students more choice on their curriculum can greatly deepen the learning experience. The psychological benefits of a student-led approach are noteworthy, mainly on how it is imperative in creating a profound sense of ownership. By bringing student’s interests to the forefront by designing their curriculum, educators can make high school education more relevant and engaging for all students. Therefore, schools should allow and encourage students to participate in curating their curriculum in order to enhance the learning experience and lead to all-around success.
