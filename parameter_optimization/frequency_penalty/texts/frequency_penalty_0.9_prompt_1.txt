Capital punishment, popularly known as the death sentence, is a legal procedure used in some countries to punish offenders for severe crimes such as murder. The practice of capital punishment has existed for centuries and is still being implemented in some countries, albeit with different levels of frequency. While it is a highly controversial topic, I believe that the death sentence should not be implemented globally.

The primary reason why capital punishment should not be implemented globally is that it violates human rights. Every human being has the right to life and dignity regardless of their actions or circumstances. Therefore, taking someone's life through capital punishment contradicts these fundamental rights and values shared by humanity. Besides, there exists substantial evidence suggesting that capital punishment has resulted in wrongful convictions and executions worldwide.

Secondly, implementing the death sentence globally would undermine international law and lead to moral decay. The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly prohibits cruel treatment or torture against individuals under any circumstances. Capital punishment falls into this category since it involves painful means of execution such as electrocution or lethal injection. Implementing the death sentence would also legitimize extrajudicial killings and perpetrate unlawful practices.

Another compelling argument against global implementation of the death penalty is its unreliability in preventing crime commission effectively. Crime prevention requires adequate measures such as effective policing systems, education programs on violence prevention among others that address social challenges such as poverty or drug abuse rather than Draconian laws aimed at scaring potential criminals from committing crimes.

In addition to violating human rights' principles and being ineffective in curbing criminal activity, several practical issues further prove fatal flaws in implementing capital punishments worldwide.

Notably: biased prosecution could result if discretionary power lies with judges rather than juries; punishing one person for whose actions affect decades sometimes generations gone after execution raises ethical questions regarding justice; unlike prison sentences where offenders could make some amends through restorative programs like paid labor while serving time; no restitution is possible once a death sentence rule.

Lastly, from an economic standpoint, implementing the death sentence is costlier in practice than life imprisonment since court appeals and prosecutor's costs to ensure fair sentencing procedures make it both time-intensive and costly. The longer wait before execution may cause mental stress to the prisoner.

In summary, capital punishment violates human rights laws and principles. Additionally, its effectiveness in curbing crime remains questionable with massive flaws of biased prosecution possibilities towards some specific groups of people.  From practical cost analysis perspective too implementations globally run more expensive than corrective programs besides risking wrongful convictions given the irrevocable nature of such judgments which may raise ethical questions on justice ground.

This evidence-based argument makes it conclusive that capital punishment must not be implemented as a global policy. Instead, policymakers worldwide should focus on developing alternative practices that can effectively deter criminal activities and promote restorative justice for offenders without contravening their basic human rights.
