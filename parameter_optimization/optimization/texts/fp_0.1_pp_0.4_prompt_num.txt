The issue of whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum is a topic that has been debated for many years. Some people believe that allowing students to develop their own curriculum would give them the freedom and flexibility to pursue their interests, while others argue that such a system would lead to a lack of academic rigor and structure. In this essay, I will argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can provide them with a valuable educational experience.

One reason why students should be allowed to create their own curriculum is that it would give them the opportunity to explore their interests in greater depth. At present, many high school curricula are designed to provide a general overview of various subjects without going into much detail. By creating their own curriculum, students would have the ability to focus on the areas that interest them most, whether it be literature, art, or science. Additionally, allowing students to tailor their curriculum to their interests would give them a sense of ownership over their education and may motivate them to learn more.

Another argument in favor of student curation is that it would prepare them for the real world. In any job or profession, individuals must have the ability to take initiative and self-direct if they want to excel. If students are given the opportunity to curate their own curriculum, they will develop these skills at an early age and be better prepared for college and beyond.

Opponents of student curation argue that it would lead to a lack of rigor and structure within the classroom. They contend that young students lack the maturity and judgment required to make informed choices about what they should learn. Moreover, they argue that there is a risk that some students may take an easy route and avoid subjects that are challenging but necessary.

Although these arguments have some merit, there are ways to mitigate their potential downsides. For example, schools could offer guidance counselors or teachers who would work with students to develop their curriculum and ensure that it meets certain academic standards. Additionally, schools could require students to take certain core courses before allowing them to create an individualized curriculum.

In conclusion, the benefits of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum far outweigh the potential downsides. By providing students with the opportunity to explore their interests and develop self-directed learning skills, schools can prepare them for a successful future while fostering a love of learning. While there may be some challenges associated with this approach, they are not insurmountable. Therefore, it is time for schools to seriously consider implementing a student-curated curriculum.
