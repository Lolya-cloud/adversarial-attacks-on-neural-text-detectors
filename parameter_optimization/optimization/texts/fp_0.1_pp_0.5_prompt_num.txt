In today's education system, the curriculum is designed by the educational boards, and all students have to follow the same pattern. However, with modern advancements in technology, it has become increasingly easy for students to access vast amounts of knowledge and gather information on any particular subject. This fact has led to a debate on whether high school students should be allowed to curate their academic curriculum. While some people disagree with this argument, stating that they feel the curriculum should remain standardized across the board, others argue that student-driven curriculum offers numerous benefits that cannot be achieved through standardized learning.

Firstly, it is essential to understand why students should be allowed to customize their curriculum. Standardized curriculums may leave out important subjects that a student might be passionate about, leading to disinterest and dropout rates among high school seniors. By contrast, if students could take ownership of their curriculum, they would be more engaged in subjects that matter most to them and stay motivated throughout their high school years.

Secondly, different students have different goals in life. Some students might want to pursue a career in a specific field that is not offered in the general curriculum. However, these students may find that the strictly imposed curriculum inhibits their interests and passions. In such cases, allowing students to choose what subjects they'd like to study could help them achieve their desired career path.

Thirdly, individualizing the high school curriculum helps students develop vital critical thinking and decision-making skills. The process of choosing what topics to include in the curriculum allows students to become self-directed learners who can articulate what they wish to learn while taking into consideration their passions, strengths, and limitations. This skill will come in handy when it comes time for them to apply to college or enter the workforce.

Fourthly, creating an individual curriculum can benefit students from marginalized communities. Students who identify with different gender identities, have different religious beliefs, or come from diverse cultural backgrounds may find it challenging to find themselves fitting into the standardized, one-size-fits-all curriculum. If given the chance to create their academic programs, students from such backgrounds could incorporate their unique perspectives into their learning plans.

In conclusion, while the debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school program is still ongoing, there are multiple advantages to investigating. Empowering students to take an active role in creating their academic programs would help engage them with their studies, pursuit their passion, and promote critical thinking skills. As educators continue to discuss and reflect on high school curriculum design, it is crucial that they thoroughly evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of different strategies and consider implementing a more student-focused approach that would meet the needs of all students.
