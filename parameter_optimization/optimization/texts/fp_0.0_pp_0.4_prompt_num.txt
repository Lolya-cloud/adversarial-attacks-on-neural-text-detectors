In many school systems across the world, students are limited to a predetermined set of courses that they must take to pass high school. While this traditional approach has been in place for many years, some advocates argue that these restrictions often limit the potential of students. Many believe that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum as per the subjects they are interested in. This essay presents multiple reasons why school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

First and foremost, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would significantly enhance their educational experience. With the freedom to choose their preferred classes, students can select subjects that suit their interests and future career paths. For example, if a student is interested in computer science, then they should be allowed to focus on programming, software design, and network management. With the freedom to choose, the student would build the foundation for their future by studying what they enjoy.

Furthermore, enabling high school students to curate their academic programs would help them develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for their education. By having the opportunity to regulate their coursework, students develop leadership skills along with management and planning abilities. Building personal schedules and managing deadlines create resourceful and responsible citizens who learn life skills that apply to more than just school.

Moreover, this approach would also assist educators by simplifying their workloads and reducing the load of perceived pointless standard educational courses. When a student chooses a course, they are the ones deciding to invest the time and effort. Consequently, there is more motivation to do the work and bring in new ideas to the classroom. Moreover, when lessons are enjoyable, students pay attention and absorb knowledge beyond the syllabus.

Opponents argue that students are not capable of curating their curriculum because they lack knowledge of what is important or relevant to their future careers. However, it is ultimately the student's decision, and even if they may make mistakes, bad choices can also be seen as a valuable teaching opportunity. After all, high school is a learning experience, and students should be permitted to make decisions and experience the consequences that follow.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is necessary because it promotes student responsibility and ownership, motivation and enjoyment, and the freedom to pursue interests beyond regular courses. It is time to move away from forcing uniformity in education and embrace personalized learning. By permitting students to define their academic schedule, schools can potentially unlock abilities and talents that standard subjects cannot.
