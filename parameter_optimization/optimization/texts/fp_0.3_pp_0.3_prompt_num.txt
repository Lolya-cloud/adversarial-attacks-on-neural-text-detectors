In the current education system, students are not given much control or choice over their curriculum. Students are expected to follow a set curriculum with very little personalisation or allowance for individual interests. However, in today's world, it is important to acknowledge that every student is unique and has different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, the idea of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum has been gaining traction. In this essay, we will argue in favour of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum fosters a better learning experience for them. Students will get a chance to select subjects they are interested in and determine their progression depending on their needs. This eliminates the possibility of boredom in classes that do not challenge intellectual abilities or having to take classes deemed too difficult because they were part of a pre-planned course outline. By curating one's own syllabus, students have more flexibility and can design a course structure that meets both their intellectual pursuits and learning styles.

Secondly, students who have control over their curriculum tend to be more accountable for their learning outcomes. Since they are responsible for selecting the courses they would take; they become invested in each class' progress towards achieving identified objectives. Having engaged stakeholders guarantees a higher success rate because those directly impacted by the education benefit from selecting courses on areas that excite them. This sense of responsibility encourages students to meet academic expectations as well as pushing them further in easier subjects where they may have novelty or intrinsic interest.

Moreover, beyond fostering higher accountability rates and improved learner experiences, allowing high school students to curate an academic plan can be used as a tool for making career choices. By specifying their chosen profession early enough at the high school level and aligning subjects of interest towards that direction bridges the gap between conventional academics and real-world job requirements. It can also serve as an avenue for exploring different career paths early on and can ultimately promote intentional, structured, and achievable dreams.

On the opposing side, critics argue that students may not have the maturity or knowledge to select an appropriate curriculum independently. However, this fear is easily addressed by providing various platforms for students to make informed decisions that combine academic support as well as counselling. Before finalizing their curriculums, students can be advised on planning courses based on prerequisite requirements, teacher evaluations, and grade point averages. Consequently, with varying degrees of mature insightfulness, students should have guidance while still making autonomous decisions.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum has several benefits. It promotes a better learning experience for students as they tailor their courses to their individual interest levels and abilities. This increases accountability rates contributed by student ownership of the path towards attaining educational objectives. It is important to note that while self-selection may not entirely eliminate the role of educational guidance, students will still get support from teachers or elders in decision-making processes anchored around each specific student's academic interests and goals. Therefore, implementing such a structure in high school education should be considered as it can improve grades whilst preparing young minds for life after graduation through goal-setting and career readiness skills.
