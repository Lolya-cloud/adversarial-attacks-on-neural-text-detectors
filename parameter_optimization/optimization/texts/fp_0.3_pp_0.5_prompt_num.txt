In today's fast-paced and rapidly changing world, education has become more important than ever before. In order to meet the challenges of an uncertain future, it is essential that students receive a high-quality education that prepares them for success in both their personal and professional lives. However, the question of who should be responsible for creating that education has become increasingly important. Some argue that schools alone should have the authority to decide what courses students take, while others argue that students should have a voice in shaping their own curriculum. I believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the main reasons why students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is that it would allow for greater engagement and motivation among students. Students are more likely to be interested in subjects they choose themselves, rather than being forced into taking classes they have no interest in. By allowing students to customize their own curriculum, we can provide a more personalized learning environment that caters to the unique interests and skills of each individual student. This will not only make learning more enjoyable but also help students retain information better.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their own curriculum can help promote creativity and innovation. High schools have been traditionally structured as a one-size-fits-all model where every student has to take the same courses with no room for customization or change. This kind of rigid structure often stifles creativity and prevents students from exploring their own interests or discovering new talents. Allowing some degree of control over their own education can give rise to new ideas and open doors to possibilities they never imagined before.

Furthermore, curation of high school curriculum by students could lead to better alignment between education and workforce needs. According to various reports, there is currently a skills gap between what most graduates know and what employers require in many fields. Customizing high school curriculums would enable them both academically and skillfully ready for their future goals and aspirations. Students can identify the competitive industry roles and skills that they need to have in the future, and this could help guide their course selections while still satisfying the minimum requirements. 

Some opponents to this might argue that allowing students to curate their own curriculum might lead them to choose easier subjects or those they feel comfortable with, which may leave gaps in their education. However, these concerns can be addressed by providing clear guidelines, counseling from education experts, and accountability measures.

In conclusion, it is clear that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. This would create a learning environment that is more engaging, creative, personalized while better aligning the education path with workforce needs. The ultimate goal of education is to prepare students for a bright future and lifelong success, and giving them control over their own education can help achieve this goal far better than rigid one-size-fits-all models. After all, who can understand our learning styles and passions better than ourselves?
