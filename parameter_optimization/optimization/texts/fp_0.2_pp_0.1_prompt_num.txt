In today's educational landscape, there is an ongoing debate about whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Some people believe that students should have greater flexibility and control over their education, while others argue that the current academic system is well-rounded and comprehensive enough. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why empowering high school students to curate their own curriculum is a positive step towards a more effective and engaged educational experience.

Firstly, allowing students to participate in curriculum development can aid in creating a better engagement with the material. Currently, students in high school are generally required to complete a standard set of courses and subjects regardless of their interests or academic strengths. This approach falls short in motivating and challenging the students because it is not engaging. Students who are passionate about arts or music, for instance, may feel bored or disengaged if forced to study math and science exclusively. However, if they have the flexibility to choose courses that match their interests and passions, they are more likely to excel and remain engaged with the material.

Secondly, curating their own curriculum can provide students with life skills such as decision-making and mentorship from teachers. Because they will be motivated by their interests, the students would be more likely to carefully consider which subjects they take in high school. This practice is an effective way for them to develop independent thinking and problem-solving skills that would be useful in all walks of life. Students making course choices might also be able to work indirectly with teachers who are interested in similar fields. These mentors can direct students regarding academic requirements for college or professional career goals.

Moreover, curating their own curriculum can lead to better career opportunities for the students because they specialize in areas they enjoy or are passionate about. High school students would be able to focus on areas of study that correspond with their natural talents, abilities, and interests. By doing so, it can ultimately encourage better career choices that correspond with their passions and strengths. Some students might choose an unconventional career path, and, if encouraged by the school system, they might find more success than they would have otherwise had they chosen a conventional career.

Another point to consider is that curating the curriculum is entirely necessary for students who are under immense academic pressures and stress. Due to the current academic system demanding good grades, performing well in extracurricular activities, and balancing all of these while trying to secure college admissions, students' stresses become unmatched. Allowing students to curate their curriculum will remove unnecessary pressure from their lives and allow them to focus on courses and subjects they are genuinely interested in.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum is a positive step towards creating an engaging, effective educational experience. This approach motivates students to explore their passions and work harder towards their ambitions, provides life skills, improves career prospects, and removes stress from their academic journey. It is therefore advisable that schools embrace this approach to further empower their students.
