The education system has evolved over the years, with schools offering diverse curriculums to cater to students’ interests and career choices. However, school students have limited autonomy over their education as curriculums are predetermined by educational institutions and regulatory bodies. This essay argues that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum as it enhances their educational experience by fostering individualism, personalized learning, and critical thinking.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum empowers them to take charge of their education and fosters individualism. The current education system is often rigid, limiting the scope for creativity and personal preferences. Students have the ability to choose their subjects and tailor their learning experience based on their abilities and career aspirations. Curating the curriculum allows them to explore different avenues of knowledge outside traditional streams such as science or arts. For instance, a student who enjoys computer coding could choose courses related to programming languages, artificial intelligence or data analytics instead of traditional subjects such as history or literature. Thus, curating the curriculum values diversity in knowledge and enables students' unique strengths.

Secondly, curating one's high school curriculum promotes personalized learning that caters to individuals' needs and aptitudes. Many students struggle with certain subjects but excel in others; having a choice in classes they can take ensures that they learn better in an environment tailored to meet their skill levels. For example, a student struggling with Mathematics could opt out of Higher-level Math courses while focusing on complementary Science classes that include practical laboratory sessions that enhance scientific skills beyond theoretical knowledge. Customizing one's learning path can increase motivation levels which catapults achievement scores.

Finally, curation of the high school curriculum requires critical thinking skills- an essential tool for success beyond academia. By making informed decisions on subject selections aligning with personal interests and endeavors that impact academic goals is what life after graduation entails—thus providing opportunities for crucial decision-making skills to be practiced alongside guidance and feedback from educators. As students weigh their options, they develop independent thinking skills that equip them to make well-informed choices in the future.

In conclusion, students should have autonomy over their education by curating their high school curriculum. As mentioned above, having these privileges instills a sense of self-reliance, personalization beyond traditional learning goals and fosters decision-making skills that give learners an edge, way beyond school years. In the era where interdisciplinary studies are becoming more prevalent than ever before, flexibility allows students to remain current with global trends while honing in on their particular skill sets and interests. Therefore, empowering students through personal curation of curriculum benefits not only students but creates well-rounded individuals prepared for academic success along with thriving in diverse conditions outside classroom walls.
