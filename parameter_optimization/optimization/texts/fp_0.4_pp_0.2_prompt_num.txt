The high school curriculum is the stepping stone for a student's future. It provides the foundation needed to succeed in college and in the workforce. However, current high school curriculums do not always align with students' interests or career goals. Therefore, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum to ensure that they receive an education that prepares them for their future.

Firstly, permitting students to select their courses will increase their engagement in learning. When students are presented with a selection of courses curated to their interests, they are more likely to become excited about learning and increase participation in class. Furthermore, studies have shown that when students choose classes tailored to their interests, it results in better grades and increased attendance.

Moreover, a student's involvement in selecting the curricular subjects can create a personal connection to topics relevant to them. This personalized approach can foster independent critical thinking skills and result in more engaged learners. Furthermore, the ownership of one's education will encourage students to take responsibility for their victories as well as failures.

In addition, guiding adolescents towards specific interdisciplinary paths based on interest and aptitude can enhance academic goal achievement. By focusing on studies aligned with their career preferences, high schoolers can use this time to gain useful skills relevant to achieving a successful future career.

Another argument for allowing students greater control of their education involves cultivating emotional intelligence learned through evaluating different options available at various schools based on factors such as teaching culture, dress code policies and facilities. Curating one's course load further empowers self-awareness development during these formative years.

Notwithstanding these reasons for curation empowerment implementation comes speculation regarding how this process would work logistically concerning school schedules and class sizes; especially given some states require fulfillment of state-wide educational mandates.

Opponents may argue that allowing students greater autonomy could lead to neglecting key areas such as humanities or basic science requirements considered crucial by educational institutions. There exists room within these guidelines, however, for variations in how to approach these core curricular necessities while also indulging interest-driven learning activities with the inclusion of alternative subjects.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will enhance their engagement in learning and encourage self-awareness achievement throughout adolescence. Such a framework most effectively equips students to become future leaders who utilize critical thinking skills to evaluate relevant professional criteria. Consequently, investing in the relevance of curating high school selection will ultimately benefit society as a whole by producing thoughtful members with specialized areas of expertise and increased passion for their work.
