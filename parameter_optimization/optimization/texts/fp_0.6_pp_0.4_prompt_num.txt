In a traditional classroom setting, students are often presented with a pre-determined set of courses in which they are required to enroll. However, as time passes more and more students have been demanding the power to make choices concerning their high school curriculum. The question that arises is whether or not students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. This essay will argue that allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum would enhance academic performance by allowing them to pursue studies tailored toward personal interests.

The integration of student-led curriculum in high schools has become an increasingly popular trend in recent times. The current education system fails to consider the diverse needs and interests of individual learners, thus leading to disinterest on the part of some students. If students are given space in determining what they learn and how they learn it, interest levels will increase causing better retention of knowledge and improved academic performance.

Personalisation creates an opportunity for positive change in learning as it aligns educational experiences with students' ambitions and interests at different stages of life. When pupils operate autonomously, the focus shifts from rigid legislations that provide little scope for creativity towards adopting innovative teaching mechanisms that engage learners while guaranteeing desirable results.

Involving highschoolers in choosing classes is a powerful policy shift considering that the youth are considered significant stakeholders influencing future research and development verticals. At this age, most individuals begin figuring out who they want to be when they grow up - their aspirations beyond graduation day - and exploring specific fields could provide useful early insights into career options.

Moreover, there's also an ethical argument; schools must prepare dynamic individuals with practical skills that enable them ready for real-world challenges such as communication or teamwork abilities rather than merely adhering strictly prescribed coursework outlined by rigourous principles at both state- and nationwide levels.

On the flip side of this coin lies legitimate concerns regarding how much agency should be provided because all elements must have barriers so as not to handicap students. Self-motivation, initiative, and even organisation will be critical traits that learners will need to possess if they are ever to succeed outside the four walls of school. It must also be understood that not all students will make the best choices regarding what to learn insofar as some may not appreciate their strengths and weaknesses without external guidance. Therefore, schools should work hand-in-hand with families and counsellors who can encourage pupils in identifying courses necessary for obtaining skills relevant to aspiring career paths.

In conclusion, student-led curriculums enable students to identify and explore fields aligned with their interests while being given space to pursue it autonomously. By consigning control over learning curves and paths in choosing coursework primarily based on both their strengths and professional ambitions alongside guidance from mentors such as family or counselling services fostering accountability among youths, educational disadvantage due lack of interest may become a thing of the past!
