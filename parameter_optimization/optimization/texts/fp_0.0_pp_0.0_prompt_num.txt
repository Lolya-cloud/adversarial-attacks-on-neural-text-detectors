There is an ongoing debate about whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Some people argue that students should have more control over their education and be allowed to choose the courses they want to take and the subjects they want to study. Others believe that leaving this decision in the hands of students could have negative consequences. I firmly believe that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Empowering students to choose their classes, projects, and assignments can pave the way for self-discovery and personal growth. Allowing students to follow their passions and learning styles would result in a more engaging learning experience. Furthermore, they will feel more responsible for their education and have a feeling of ownership and accountability for their academic success. Research suggests that students who feel ownership over their education are more likely to apply themselves and perform better in their studies.

By curating their own curriculum, students can choose to participate in more hands-on, experiential learning opportunities. They are more likely to take courses that they are interested in and passionate about, not just because that's what the institution offers. This approach can promote creativity and innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, which are essential for today's workforce. High school students who learn how to think critically and solve problems creatively leave school better prepared for the challenges ahead.

Moreover, students' engagement level can increase because their learning goals align more closely with their interests. They are more likely to make connections between what they are learning in the classroom and how it relates to their daily lives and the world around them. This fosters an environment where students become more engaged and more interested in learning. It is evident that students who have more control over their learning have a better chance of achieving academic success.

There are those who argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to children not being exposed to essential subjects. They feel that given free rein to make choices will limit their exposure to a broad range of topics, leading to knowledge gaps. However, that concern is mitigated by ensuring that parents, teachers, and guidance counselors are still involved, guiding and supporting students in making appropriate choices in line with their goals. Additionally, allowing students to choose what they study in high school enhances their personal non-cognitive skills such as time management, decision-making, and independence.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. This approach will foster a passion for learning, increase engagement, and promote academic success. Moreover, it prepares students for the challenges of the workforce and enhances their non-cognitive skills. It is essential to note that while the self-curated curriculum should not eliminate essential subjects, it should provide an avenue for students to choose what they are interested in, aligning their goals with their interests. Therefore, schools should involve students more in their process to choose and design their courses, subjects, and assignments.
