Education plays a crucial role in the development of young people. Students are expected to receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for future academic and professional endeavors. However, the current education system has been called into question by both students and educators. While the system has evolved to meet the needs of today's changing world, it still fails to provide students with a personalized education experience. This has led to a growing debate about whether high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum.

The primary argument in favor of allowing students to curate their curriculum is to create a more individualized learning experience. It is argued that by allowing students to curate their curriculum, they can select courses based on their interests and strengths. Therefore, the curriculum will be tailored to meet their individual needs, unlike the current traditional system that does not offer such flexibility. This will provide students with an opportunity to explore their passions, which could lead to increased motivation and engagement in their studies.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their curriculum will provide them with more choices, which could provide them with an advantage when making decisions about future academic or professional pursuits. They will be able to choose subjects they find intriguing and that would potentially lead them down a career path they are passionate about.

On the contrary, critics argue that the current education system already offers ample choices of courses that cater to a variety of interests. Additionally, allowing students to curate their curriculum might lead to gaps in knowledge and overemphasize certain areas at the expense of others. Furthermore, they argue that high school students may not have sufficient knowledge or experience to make sound decisions about what they need studying.

However, these criticisms can be addressed through an integration where students can select courses from preset options as well as work with guidance counsellors or teachers who can make informed recommendations on their behalf.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is crucial for creating a more personalized learning experience. While there are legitimate concerns about the risks involved, properly structured, it will create an education system that better serves the needs of students.

It is time for schools to embrace new education techniques and allow students the independence, self-motivation and empowerment to take responsibility for their learning. With access to information from different sources and different views on a subject, students will be better equipped to understand and tackle real-world challenges. Ultimately, it is only through a tailored curriculum that students can be nurtured into successful adults who can meaningfully contribute to society.
