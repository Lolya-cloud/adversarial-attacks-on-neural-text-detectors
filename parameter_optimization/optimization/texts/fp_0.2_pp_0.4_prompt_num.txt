In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for schools to allow students to curate their curriculums. While some people believe that this might lead to a more engaged and motivated student body, others argue that it could lead to a lack of rigor in education. In this essay, I argue that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

First and foremost, allowing students to curate their curriculum will provide them with more ownership over their learning. When students are given the opportunity to select courses and tailor their schedules to their interests, they become more invested in their education. They develop a sense of accountability for their studies and feel empowered by the responsibility granted to them in a classroom setting. As such, it would benefit both individual students as well as the education system as a whole if they are permitted to participate in creating their high school curriculums.

Moreover, allowing students more freedom when it comes to selecting coursework would enable them to explore subjects they're passionate about in greater depth. Currently, many high schools offer limited options when it comes to electives or specialized coursework. Students may want to take classes that don't fit into this narrow category or engage with subjects previously unavailable to them. By allowing students the freedom to choose what they learn, educators can create an environment where each student can reach their potential and fully explore all topics relevant to them.

Additionally, if students are allowed to curate their own curriculum, it could spark creativity and innovation within the educational system. As teachers must adapt course material based on individual student goals and interests instead of strict adherence to textbooks, they could use this opportunity creatively by planning out unique units and lesson plans that deviate from the norm.

Finally, it's essential to note that while many concerns have arisen as schools look for ways to fulfill these demands, these fears are mostly unwarranted. Some individuals worry that permitting students to direct their coursework could lead to a lack of rigor or that they might avoid classes they deem challenging. However, it must be noted that students care about academic success and embrace challenging material all the time already. Such issues can be addressed with appropriate guidance, and many students who are hesitant to challenge themselves soon change their minds when presented with fascinating opportunities.

In conclusion, students should be allowed more autonomy when it comes to their high school curricula. Allowing students to select courses that align more closely with their interests would provide them greater ownership of their education and could spark creativity and ingenuity within school systems. So, policymakers should seek ways to set up frameworks for curricular innovation so that schools can better meet the needs of their individual students. Ultimately it will create a more dynamic and stimulating environment where students are more invested in their educational pursuits and acquire deeper knowledge of subjects they're passionate about.
