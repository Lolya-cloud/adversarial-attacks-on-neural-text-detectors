Education is an essential part of any individual's life, and it serves as the foundation for their future success. However, the traditional education system no longer caters to the diverse needs of students. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the interests and abilities of individual students when curating their high school curriculum. It has led to a debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum or not. This essay argues that students should have the freedom to decide their curriculum as it promotes personalized learning, enhances student motivation, and prepares them for their future.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum promotes personalized learning. Each student has unique interests and academic strengths, which require different approaches to learning. Therefore, a pre-set curriculum might not cater to each student's desires and abilities effectively. Allowing them to pursue subjects that interest them can help build on their potentials while also expanding their knowledge in understudied areas. A personal approach also creates a sense of ownership in education outcomes and ultimately leads to a sense of accomplishment in academics.

Secondly, curating their high school curriculum can motivate students towards academic endeavours since they need access to learn what they want. Students are more likely motivated in subjects they choose for themselves compared to subjects assigned by instructors due to social-emotional factors such as choice enhancement and intrinsic motivation as they would perceive education to be free will than an obligatory activity.

Furthermore, allowing students greater autonomy could have positive long-term implications. The skills acquired by curating the curriculum can prepare them for university studies where independent research skills are a crucial aspect of higher education levels through choosing a major with somewhat related courses would familiarise them with college structure thus easing course selection challenges at college level.

On the other hand, opponents argue that allowing individual students' involvement in selecting courses might lead overlook important topics outside their focus limit such as personal finance management or public speaking courses or ignore some critical academic standards requirements such as proficiency in languages and sciences.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum promotes personalized learning, enhances student motivation, and prepares them for their future. Therefore, schools should consider integrating student perspectives and needs in the current education system to create a dynamic and sustainable curriculum. A higher level of self-regulated learning leads to better academic outcomes by building on the individual's strengths and particular interests. Thus encouraging students' independence can lead to a healthier higher learning environment where students are more committed to academic accomplishments hence resulting in greater individual school success.
