As the world changes around us, so too must education adapt and evolve to keep pace. As such, there is a growing debate over whether high school students should be permitted to curate their own curriculum in order to tailor their education to suit their individual needs and interests. While there are certainly arguments against this proposal, I believe that students should have the right to create their own high school curriculum.

To begin with, allowing students to shape their own educational paths can be an effective strategy for promoting engagement and motivation. It is difficult for young people to remain invested in subjects they find uninteresting or irrelevant, and for many students, traditional curricula simply do not cater effectively to their unique passions and skills. By giving them the opportunity to choose the topics that they want to learn about, they are more likely to feel invested in their education and therefore more motivated to learn.

Furthermore, allowing students to shape their own high school curriculum has the potential for significant benefits in terms of post-secondary preparation. During high school, students are tasked with developing a diverse range of skills that will prepare them for university or college. However, when these skills are taught within subjects that are largely irrelevant or uninteresting, it can be difficult for students to understand how they will actually apply them in real life. By tailoring their own curricula, students can focus on these skills in context, making the material more immediately relevant and therefore more meaningful.

Opponents of this proposal may argue that creating personalised curricula will lead to gaps in knowledge or a lack of comprehension across key subjects. However, it is important to note that a communal syllabus model does not necessarily lead to true comprehension or knowledge retention. When subjects are taught solely for the purpose of checking boxes on a syllabus, learning is often reduced down to shallow memorisation and regurgitation. Students who curate their own high school curriculum are likely to spend more time exploring subjects that interest them deeply, leading to a more nuanced and profound understanding.

Ultimately, I believe that students should be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum. This approach promotes a richer educational experience, is better aligned with the varied interests of modern students and provides a more effective framework for post-secondary preparation. While there are certainly challenges to implementing this model of education, the potential rewards are significant â€“ not just for individual students, but for the entire education system as a whole. By empowering students to take ownership of their learning journeys, we stand to create a generation of engaged and motivated young people who are equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in an ever-changing world.
