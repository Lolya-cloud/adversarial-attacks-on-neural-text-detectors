Introduction:

Education has come a long way from the traditional teaching methods, where students were spoon-fed with information that was thought to be the best for them. With several innovative approaches being adopted, educators now understand that students learn better when they have control over the content and method of instruction. However, there are still rigid systems in education, and students are often forced to follow a set curriculum without any say. In this essay, we argue that school students should have the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum.

Body:

1) Personalized Learning
One size doesn't fit all; every student has unique learning ability, pace, and interests. Therefore allowing high school students to advance in an academic curriculum tailored towards their individual strengths and weaknesses can improve motivation and result in higher achievement levels.

2) Life Skills Learning for Better Future 
High school should offer a curriculum beyond the core subjects; instead, it should prepare students for life's practicalities starting from basic financial literacy to social awareness training. How much value does Pythagoras theorem add without knowing how to budget earnings, create a resume or navigate new social environments?

3) Enhance Engagement and Investment 
When teachers involve students in creating their learning paths, they become invested in their education. As such it is more likely that they pay attention in class because they know they chose what matters most and are less likely to feel compelled to do things they don't care about.

4) Prospects of Social Impact 
Allowing high school students more say over curricular content could promote active citizenship by sparking interest in local problems whilst improving student-to-student collaboration. This collaborative effort takes effect as each student shares skills with other students from various personal backgrounds, creating an overall sense of shared duty.

5) Balance for Mental Health 
A set curriculum can cause weariness among students unable to cope with some particular subjects or components of a syllabus. Allowing those able learners to explore interest or skillets in alternative subjects that can be stimulating while still within the institution's acceptable framework could positively affect their mental health.

Conclusion: 
The students who attend high school are the ones who know whether they are learning what they need most, and are therefore the people best placed to offer recommendations on what works for them. Allowing high school students to suggest curricular contents or create a course selection with proper guidance could significantly improve their learning experience. Personalizing education should not only help higher grades but also provide long-term benefits throughout life. It is essential that authorities consider more flexible and personalized educational paths because educating the next generation is vital to society's future development.
