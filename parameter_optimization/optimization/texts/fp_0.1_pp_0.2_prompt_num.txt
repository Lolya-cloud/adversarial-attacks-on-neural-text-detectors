Education is a fundamental aspect of every society. In the contemporary fast-paced world, the traditional education system has become outdated and inefficient in addressing the needs of students. It is essential for educational institutions to innovate and adapt to accommodate the diverse learning preferences of students. One of the proposed solutions is allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. However, this approach has faced mixed reactions as some people are in support of it while others firmly oppose it. This essay examines both sides of the argument and concludes that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curricula.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum grants students the freedom to choose courses that align with their interests and career aspirations. Under the current system, students are forced to study subjects that they might have no interest in, and these courses are often irrelevant to their future careers. For example, a student with a passion for music might be forced to take classes on mathematical formulas, which they will never use in their lives. Curriculum flexibility ensures that the student selects courses that are of interest to them, thus improving their academic performance. Students who study subjects they are interested in are more motivated, leading to better grades and higher levels of engagement with the learning process.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can improve social justice. The current system is rigid, making it difficult for students from low-income backgrounds to access subjects that require expensive resources. Curriculum flexibility can provide such students with opportunities to access these courses, which can create a level playing field. For example, students who cannot afford high-end computer courses currently miss out on opportunities in Computer Science. Allowing them to choose other available courses can provide a pathway to access these critical areas.

On the other hand, opponents argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can compromise academic standards and result in shallow learning experiences. They claim that giving students complete control over what they study can allow them to avoid challenging subjects, which are essential for their future careers. They also assert that students are not mature and knowledgeable enough to make sound decisions regarding the courses to study.

However, these arguments lack empirical evidence. Students who choose their courses can meet the same academic standards as those following the traditional curriculum, provided that the school gives them adequate support and guidance. Providing students with the tools to make informed decisions can empower them to curate an education path that is both challenging and fulfilling.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is a progressive move in the right direction towards achieving higher standards of education. The flexibility of the curriculum allows students to select courses that align with their interests, which makes learning both engaging and motivating, improving academic outcomes. Additionally, curriculum flexibility can create social justice by providing a level playing field for disadvantaged students. Schools should encourage students to embrace this new approach to education by providing the necessary guidance and resources to achieve academic excellence.
