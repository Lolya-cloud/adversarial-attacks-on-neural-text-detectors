The education system is meant to prepare students for their careers and future lives. However, the current curriculum of most high schools is not accommodating to the diverse needs and interests of students. It is unfair that even after completing compulsory courses, students have little say in their choice of subjects. Therefore, it is imperative that schools give learners the opportunity to curate their own curriculum. As such, this essay explores the benefits of allowing high school students to choose their own courses.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enhance student engagement and motivation. Currently, high school students are often disinterested in the subjects they study since they have no power over what they learn. Students do not choose courses based on interest but rather based on what is compulsory or what parents approve of or on peer pressure. A study by Kathleen Cotton found out that when given a chance to pick electives courses, student attendance and motivation improve significantly since learners excited about learning succeed more (Miller). By choosing courses based on personal interests, students are motivated as they pursue topics that create a sense of excitement for them.

Secondly, curation of individual course load allows students to specialize early in areas they deem as essentials for furthering their careers or gaining admission to preferred colleges. The current high school curriculum has limited subject options. For example, schools mainly offer biology as a science course option regardless of whether a student has an interested in medical fields or not (Norton). Thus by allowing young adults tailor-make their academics assists them early specialization and career preparation.

Thirdly, curation enhances creativity and innovation among young adults who believe in creating new things rather than doing traditional things through memorization (Clark). Classes such as robotics or machine learning enable these kids groups express themselves through building innovations—kids can take these classes if we adjust our offerings through responsive informative data collection among schools across America.

Overall though there’s no one-size-fits-all option, High school learners should be accorded freedom to select their subjects that best suits interest, passion, and future goals. In addition, it is an excellent strategy to curb high school dropouts as many of them lose interest in an overly rigid curriculum and fail to see the relevance of some courses.

In conclusion, high school education could undergo a transformative change if students were allowed more control over their academic syllabus. It is vital that schools provide individual course options to students based on interests if we want the next generation to exhibit creativity in different domains. Through strategic reorganization of our academic offerings and study pattern changes will inevitably foster creative geniuses who can make significant contributions on the global stage. Hence it's essential for parents and educators alike to advocate for more flexibility within schools' curriculums as it has a positive impact on both student engagement and motivation as well as promotes better career preparedness among learners of diverse backgrounds.
