Education is an essential aspect of human life, shaping the way individuals perceive and interact with their environment. Thus, it comes as no surprise that there is an ongoing debate regarding the role of students in curating their high school curriculum. On one side, there are proponents who argue that students' input should be considered when designing their coursework while others argue against it. This essay will explore and provide a strong argument supporting the idea that high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum.

Firstly, one of the most significant benefits of allowing students to curate their curriculum would be increased engagement and motivation towards learning. Allowing students to have a say in what they learn allows them to invest in subjects that inspire interest or passion, which translates into better academic performance. As a result, this increases outcome efficiency – students would invest time and effort into studies willingly since they have chosen the related courses instead of being forced to learn something they feel has little relevance.

Secondly, creating a student-led system would set the stage for important lifelong skills such as critical thinking skills, decision-making abilities, and broadened perspectives. When students are given more autonomy over what courses they choose to take and how they approach them will teach them important lessons about active learning involvement and choice-making – skills vital outside of academia.

Allowing student input cultivates critical thinkers who find creative solutions through brainstorming sessions & free-thinking exercises that engages both teacher-facilitator interaction & peer-to-peer collaborative learning opportunities.

Furthermore, high schools aiming to broaden diversity within academics can allow various ways for curiosity-driven learners seeking unique programs or multidisciplinary project-based goals/assignments coincide with pre-designed core classes . For instance, STEM-centric schools often pride themselves upon 'making young engineers' due to rigorous curriculums. Still can coexist with those passionate about drama club or journalism newspaper extracurriculars by adequately balancing course demands & minimized credit requirements towards their interests.

However, some argue that students should not curate their curriculum because they lack the mental and emotional maturity to make such significant decisions at a young age. This argument is fundamentally flawed as their opinion suggests is inherently contradictory, advocating both the development of "autonomous, conscientious adults," yet simultaneously insinuating that teenagers are limited in self-determination abilities.

To conclude, allowing high school students to curate their coursework would bring immense benefits to academic progression and development – promoting life skills vital in the modern world. Efforts could be made towards structuring more personalized programs that transcend every individual student's abilities and interests while appropriately addressing core requirements that ensure successful graduation. By trusting students' study autonomy will benefit them for many years beyond just academia means appreciating scholars as being capable of taking ownership towards nurturing curiosity-driven habits that inspire innovation & growth.
