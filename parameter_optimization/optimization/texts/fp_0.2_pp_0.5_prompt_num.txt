Education is a foundation for success, and the high school curriculum plays a major role in shaping an individual's progress towards their future. Traditionally, schools dictate the curriculum for students, directing them to take specific courses without considering their interests or future goals. Throughout the years, this method of fixed curriculums limited students from developing a particular skill set or getting exposed to subjects that might ignite their passion. As such, there is an ongoing debate that revolves around whether students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. In this essay, I will argue why high school students should have the freedom to curate their curriculum.

Firstly, the current education system is flawed as many students often feel overwhelmed by rigid curriculums that prioritize grades over knowledge acquisition. Often, students are coerced into taking courses that don't interest them but are considered essential for graduation. This makes it challenging for them to remain engaged and motivated in class, which negatively impacts their performance over time. However, if students were given the chance to create their curriculum, they would be more likely to choose those subjects that resonate with them best.

Secondly, with rapid technological changes taking place globally and the increasing competition within diverse career fields, it is essential for high school graduates to have specialized skills and knowledge that align with their desired career paths. Allowing students to curate their curriculum better promotes specialized learning rather than general education. Students can tailor their curriculum towards specific careers, increasing their chances of gaining practical experience while still in high school.

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their curriculum gives them a sense of ownership and a greater connection with learning. When students have a say in what they learn, they tend to become more invested in applying themselves and doing meaningful work. The motivation created by having control over coursework sees them excel in academic life as they develop self-discipline and high-level thinking skills.

However, some people may argue against this approach, stating that students are still too young to make decisions about their academic futures. They believe that curating a curriculum needs adequate expertise and experience rooted in the education system. While there is some merit to this statement, it is essential to note that students know themselves better than anyone else and are more likely to choose courses that pique their interest and set them on a path towards success.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum sparks curiosity and interest towards education, as well as helps in preparing them for their future careers. Students will be able to learn subjects relevant to what they want to achieve, which instills innovative thinking as well as practical skills applicable in real-life situations. Hence, it is necessary for schools to shift from a one-size-fits-all model of education and adopt a more student-centric approach by giving them the freedom to choose what subjects they learn to promote meaningful academic experiences.
