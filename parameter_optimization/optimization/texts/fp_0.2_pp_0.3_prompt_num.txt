In the contemporary world, most high schools follow a predetermined academic curriculum that is primarily geared towards offering traditional subjects. They determine what courses a student will study in their high school years and which ones they will skip. However, there has been a growing debate on whether students should have the right to curate their curriculum or not. Proponents argue that it allows flexibility and personalization, while others suggest that it may lead to imbalanced academic experiences for students. This essay explores this debate and argues that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum as it enhances learning by prioritizing individual strengths, preferences, and interests.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their curriculum offers increased flexibility and customization compared to the standard curriculum. Traditional curriculums often cater to a broad range of students, and certain subjects may not align well with individual student interests or strengths. Enabling school students to personalize their educational pathway can significantly enhance their educational experience and motivation for learning. For instance, if a student is passionate about computer science, they would benefit from selecting advanced courses related to their interests rather than spending time on subjects they find boring or irrelevant. When given such an opportunity, students' commitment and performance increase due to taking ownership of their learning.

Moreover, allowing students to choose what they want to study in high school represents the transition into adulthood as they begin to take control of their lives. Ultimately, this process prepares them for life beyond education where choosing what they pursue is a vital skill early exposure can teach them. Therefore, curation enables students to be proactive about what they want out of their education and examine specific course requirements needed for future institution applications or careers.

However, critics argue that allowing students to create their own course work could lead to unbalanced educational experiences. They fear that without a standard curriculum's oversight, student skills and knowledge may be skewed in one area because of self-selection of courses towards favored pursuits at the expense of foundational, fundamental knowledge. Although there is some truth in this concern, a flexible curriculum facilitated through regular communication between teachers, parents and its student explorers can ensure that learning continues to be well-rounded and constant.

Finally, students allowed to curate their high school curriculums have been historically shown to have academically superior results. A study conducted by UC Berkley found out that "students who are empowered with such selection via personalization have better academic performance as they exhibit more intrinsic motivation, improved participation in classes with advanced subject matter or areas that best align with their skill sets and interests." As a result, students are better positioned for post-secondary studies or professional pursuits within their areas of interest or applications demanded by future educational institutions or career prospects.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum has many advantages as it facilitates customization of education based on individual skills and interests. It is an intelligent idea whose time has come to ensure students creation of solid academic foundations as they progress educationally and professionally. It is only fair for schools to permit such flexibility to help students take control of their lives upon graduation into adulthood. While there may be disadvantages, they can be overlooked with proper curriculum design processes maintained via regular communication between students, parents and teachers ensuring well-rounded development.
