Education is the pillar of society, and it crushes the dreams of many students. The existing education system is outdated, and common curricula inundate students with irrelevant information that doesn't prepare them for life. Most high school graduates lack the skills to take on different challenges outside school. However, this paradigm needs to shift towards a student-centered approach as it empowers learners to make informed decisions about their future.

Thus, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum based on their interest areas. A personalized curriculum will enable students to take courses based on what they want to study rather than what they are required to study. It will ensure that all high school graduates graduate with skills and knowledge that are relevant in their lives beyond academia.

Personalized curricula can have other benefits too. It can improve student motivation and performance in courses they enjoy while also ensuring students are better prepared for careers as the workforce becomes more diverse and dynamic. Additionally, this could decrease the rate of dropouts as students aren't forced to stay in courses they dislike.

Moreover, schools could provide guidance counselors or academic advisors who would work with individual students to tailor their curriculum according to personal interests and goals.

Opponents of this proposal argue that it will create an uneven education standard where some students have access to better or easier classes than others. However, this argument can be disproved because underperforming students would still have access to core curricula like Math, Science and Literature.

Furthermore, developing individual student interests may result in a more competitive society that values creativity rather than mere intellectualism. As a result of personalized educational plans, more entrepreneurs could come up with unique ideas for products or services based on their passions rather than trying to start businesses which follow established models.

In conclusion, allowing school students curate their desired paths through high school might not be conventional education but offers aspirants a chance at building practical careers upon graduation. It helps nurture inherent creativity, passion, and potential that conventional curricula cannot offer. Not only can students develop relevant skill sets based on personal interests and passions, but also reduce the stress of attending compulsory lectures. On this account, students should be granted the autonomy to choose courses according to their passions and inclinations with help from academic advisors or credit counselors.  Soon enough, we can expect to see more youth inventing innovative ideas that would propel us to a brighter future. The overall benefit is clear - personalized curricula would create a more diverse and self-motivated student body well-equipped for success in our ever-evolving world.
