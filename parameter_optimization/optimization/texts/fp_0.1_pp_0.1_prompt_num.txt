School is where students receive education that is designed to prepare them for the future, but traditional one size fits all approach of the education system might not be suited for every student. Some students might find classes boring and some might struggle with the pace of the curriculum. Therefore, it is essential to give students the ability to curate their own curriculum tailored to their needs. Despite there are some opponents, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would lead to increased engagement, better academic outcomes, and overall better-prepared high school graduate.

The current traditional education system can be inefficient due to its one size fits all approach. A student's interests, prior knowledge, and future aspirations are not considered in the curriculum. This can lead to disengagement, lack of interest, and poor academic results. On the other hand, if students are allowed to curate their curriculum, they can choose subjects that are more interesting and relevant to their future aspirations. This increased engagement will result in better academic outcomes, including improved grades and higher retention rates.

Furthermore, when students have greater control of their academic paths, they can tailor their curriculum to meet their goals outside of traditional education goals. For example, some students may have a passion for music, art, or other extracurricular activities and need more time to pursue them. Allowing them to customize their curriculum around these passions allows them to pursue their interests and develop a well-rounded skillset with academic prowess.

Moreover, current education routines might not be suitable for all students due to their different learning styles and abilities. Some may require more time or attention in certain subjects than others, while some may need different instructional supports. By allowing students to curate their own curriculum, they can cater their classes around topics that interest them and learning pathways that effectively engage them.

Critics argue that allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum may lead to missing out on core subjects in which they may need later in their life. However, this is a misguided claim. An educator-administrative body can help ensure that the curriculum is still aligned to key essential learning outcomes, while providing students with the freedom to pursue their passions.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum offers several benefits, including increased engagement, improved academic outcomes, and personalized learning experiences that advantages students' future aspirations. Students need to develop problem-solving, critical-thinking, and excellent communication skills to thrive in a knowledge-based economy. Allowing them to customize their high school curriculum will enhance those critical skills and give them a better-rounded education experience.
