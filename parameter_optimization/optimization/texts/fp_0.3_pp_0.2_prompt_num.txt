The traditional high school curriculum is often criticized for its inability to cater to students’ individual interests and skills. This lack of personalization and flexibility in high school education not only dims the enthusiasm of a learner but also leads to several long-term consequences. It might stifle creativity and critical thinking, leading to lower student engagement and retention rates. In recent years, educators have tried to find ways of making this experience more meaningful for young adults, with one possible solution being the inclusion of a student-curated high school curriculum. This essay argues that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum based on their interests and strengths will lead to better academic outcomes and help equip them with valuable skills required for success.

Firstly, allowing students to choose their high school curriculum helps them discover their passions and build their educational journey around it. When young people design their educational journey with a focus on what they are passionate about, they are motivated to learn more about the subject. Furthermore, when students focus on what they love, they are more open to producing quality work, which results in academic excellence. By giving them the ability to identify areas they wish to pursue further, educators can guarantee that they will be engaged and passionate learners.

Secondly, adopting student-curated curriculums prepares learners for their future professions by supplementing academic courses with valuable skills such as communication, leadership, and critical thinking. By prioritizing youth-driven projects such as community engagement programs or art exhibitions alongside core classes such as Math or English, students develop essential skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and effective communication necessary for success beyond the classroom. Additionally, through these initiatives, students gain hands-on experience in areas important for employability within their chosen fields.

Opponents of student-curated high school curriculums argue that allowing teenagers to decide what subjects they would like to learn can lead to bright pupils stripping themselves of fundamental knowledge within subjects that seem uninteresting. However, supporters of this idea recognize that students will continue to need core knowledge in important subjects such as English, Science, and History, but the use of customized learning methods can ensure that students enjoy learning these subjects rather than considering them a necessary burden.

Another argument often made against student-curated high school curriculums is that choosing subjects of interest leaves little room for exposure to other areas of knowledge crucial in shaping a well-rounded citizen. However, it’s essential to note that this framework can be designed with certain requirements or guidelines in place to ensure exposure to other disciplines. That way, it still gives students the freedom to choose the types of classes they prefer while maintaining a balanced distribution of core knowledge.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculums presents an opportunity for young learners to take responsibility for learning what they enjoy and develop valuable professional skills along the journey. This model will genuinely democratize high school, making it more inclusive and ultimately realizing better academic outcomes. By implementing customizable academic programs, learners can prioritize studying subjects they are passionate about and receive support from educators who understand their wants and needs. Therefore, giving young adults this freedom would result in more engaged and successful learners equipped with the professional competencies required to prosper beyond the classroom.
