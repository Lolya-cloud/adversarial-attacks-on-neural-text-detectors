Education is an integral aspect of an individual's life, and getting a sound education sets the foundation for future success. One of the most significant decisions in any student's life is choosing their high school curriculum. While some argue that a standardized curriculum ensures uniformity and proper preparedness for post-secondary education, there are many advantages to allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum.

The modern world demands individuals who can think critically and creatively, and providing students with some degree of autonomy over their learning helps nurture these skills. Students who are free to curate their curriculum not only develop their interests but also take ownership of their learning experiences. When students have some agency over the subjects studied, they become more motivated to learn them resulting in better grades, higher engagement levels, and overall better academic performance.

The traditional one-size-fits-all approach does not cater to every student's needs and capabilities. Allowing students to design the courses based on their interests will enable teachers to tailor the teaching style to meet each student's unique educational needs. By doing so, schools can impart organic learning experiences by tapping into the individual passions of learners.

Permitting certain degrees of freedom will also enhance teacher-student relationships. When students have input on what they learn, it becomes easier for educators to build rapport with them as they recede from being mere instructors to more like facilitators that guide based on each pupil’s preferences.

Another benefit of schools permitting personalized curriculums is tackling the issue of student boredom or disinterest. It's no secret that teenagers' attention spans can be fleeting; students might lose focus when bombarded with monotonous information they don’t find personally exciting or necessary for personal learning growth.  Giving young people power over what they study increases awareness and interest in topics they previously deemed irrelevant.

Of course, some people may object to a customized curriculum because they fear that it could reduce social mobility by scuppering ‘core’ subjects focussed on bridging the achievement gap. However, this could be prevented by compromising by providing a core curriculum that all students must take, with additional elective classes that allow them to personalize their high school education experience.

It's worth acknowledging that allowing self-curation of high school syllabus is tricky, and teachers will need to play a proactive role in guiding learners’ choices ensuring that they don’t choose poorly designed courses or aspects of learning. Henceforth, it's imperative that teachers are trained to help students curate their programs and ensure alignment with educational statutes.

In conclusion, allowing students to design their high school structures can be highly beneficial. Personalized curriculums create longer student attention spans while culturalizing education and teacher-student collaboration. While there are valid concerns about uniformity and preparing individuals for post-high school institutions, these challenges are not prohibitive: discussions between educators and policymakers should be invested towards formulating an effective hybrid approach without compromising the benefits of custom-designed curriculums.
