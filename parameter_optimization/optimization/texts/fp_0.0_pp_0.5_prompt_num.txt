Education is an essential part of a student’s life, as it provides them with the knowledge and skills to succeed in life. The high school curriculum forms the backbone of a student’s education, providing vital information that prepares them for college and beyond. However, some students believe that the standard high school curriculum does not meet their needs and interests. As such, there has been a growing debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Those in support of students curating their high school curriculum argue that it promotes individuality and self-expression. Every student is unique, with varying interests, talents, and goals. Giving students the opportunity to select courses that are aligned with their interests and talents can enable them to discover their passion, which can inspire and motivate them to do better in their studies. Moreover, when students take classes they are interested in, they are more likely to be engaged and participate actively in class, leading to better grades and academic success.

Additionally, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can prepare them better for the workforce or higher education. Students can choose courses relevant to their career goals or desired majors in college, enabling them to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge. The current high school curriculum follows a one-size-fits-all approach that cannot cater to every student’s needs and interests. Allowing students to shape their high school curriculum can help them gain valuable experiences that will benefit them in their future endeavors.

However, opponents of students curating their high school curriculum argue that it may result in a lack of necessary academic rigor. Critics believe that students may prioritize fun or easy classes instead of challenging classes that will prepare them adequately for college-level coursework. Moreover, giving students too much control over their high school curriculum can lead to academic imbalance, where some students excel in certain subjects while falling behind in mandatory classes like math or science.

Nevertheless, these concerns can be addressed by implementing a robust advisory system where students are guided on which courses to choose, considering their goals and interests. Students can work with advisors who will review their course plans, ensuring that they are meeting necessary requirements and receiving the academic rigor needed for success.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Allowing them to select classes aligned with their interests and career goals can provide a more significant sense of ownership of their education, motivating them to perform better academically. While concerns over academic rigor and balance are valid, implementing a well-designed advisory system can address these issues. Therefore, policymakers should consider giving students more control over their high school curriculum, recognizing that it is essential for their future success.
