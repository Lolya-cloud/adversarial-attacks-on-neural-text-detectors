High school students are often at a stage in their lives where they are beginning to discover their passions and interests. The current traditional curriculum being taught by the schools may or may not help them pursue their interests and achieve success in the long term. In such a scenario, allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum could be the best solution. This concept has been gaining steam over the years, with many experts and studies supporting the move. Therefore, it is my contention that high school students should indeed be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that education is not just about good grades or test scores; it's about acquiring knowledge that can be applied in real-life situations. Schools tend to follow a standardized curriculum mandated by the government agency, which includes subjects that might not interest some students or aren't relevant in today's world.

If allowed to curate their curriculum, students would offer more meaningful learning opportunities. Since they know what they are passionate about best, they can choose subjects related to this passion and sharpen the skills required for their desired field of work. For example, if a student wants to learn coding and develop software, they could go deeper into computer science and related disciplines like mathematics, data analysis etc. On the other hand, a student who hates the same subjects could study marketing communication or creative writing courses instead.

Secondly, there is a growing amount of evidence highlighting how personalized education can boost academic outcomes effectively. According to research conducted by Dr Kelly Wickersham from Pennsylvania University, customized learning fosters better cognitive development by providing flexible environments that cater to individual learning needs.

While a central curriculum offers standardized content across schools and regions resulting in common benchmarks, it doesn't consider differences between individual learners' contexts and backgrounds.

Lastly, Allowing students to as well as state-recognized curriculums opt for specialized electives gives rise to an integrated approach towards higher education, matching the requirements of various colleges and universities. Therefore, this move would democratize education since students would have a chance to find their way and align with industries' current demands from an early stage.

While some critics argue that the pre-designed curriculum ensures all students get a well-rounded education, the vast amount of standardized testing could stifle creative and adaptive skills that are essential for success in the 21st century.

In conclusion, empowering high school students with academic freedom bears tremendous potential for optimized learning experience,gives rise to specialized electives, while building learner agency and autonomy in selecting their study subjects. By curating their high school curriculum, students will get a better understanding of their passions and interests and improving the chances of long-term success. This user-centric approach towards education is the way forward in today's world, where people demand more personalized experiences about everything they consume. As such, schools must recognize that students should have a say in what they learn at school to promote a more rounded academic experience.
