Curating a high school curriculum is a topic that has recently come to the forefront of educational discussions. Some people believe that students should be allowed to choose their own courses, while others argue that this responsibility should be left solely in the hands of educators. While there are compelling arguments for both sides of this debate, the evidence ultimately suggests that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is not only beneficial for their academic and personal growth, but also beneficial for their future success.

To begin with, giving students the power to choose their own courses can increase their motivation and engagement in their education. When students have an active role in deciding what they will learn, they are more likely to be invested in their studies. By letting them curate their curriculum, schools can foster curiosity and develop a love for learning that can last long beyond high school. Furthermore, when students are empowered to make choices concerning their education, they can explore specific topics in greater depth and pursue individual interests.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can better prepare them for life beyond the classroom. College applications, job interviews, and everyday life all require individuals to exhibit qualities like adaptability, independence, and critical thinking. By curating their own curriculums during high school, students are given the opportunity to cultivate and strengthen these critical skills. In addition, building a personalized curriculum also gives them a chance to develop relevant skills that theyâ€™ll need in order to pursue their chosen career paths. This could lead to a better informed and more skilled workforce in the future.

Additionally, giving students this responsibility can aid educators in making informed decisions about the structure and content of their courses. By incorporating student feedback, instructors can develop more effective and engaging coursework that caters to the individual interests of their students. This collaboration between teachers and students can improve the overall quality of education provided by the school.

Some may argue that allowing students to curate their own curriculums could result in academic discrepancies and hinder students' success. However, schools can easily establish parameters and guidelines for student-selected courses in order to ensure that they are still meeting educational standards and requirements. These guidelines can help students maintain balance within a range of required subjects like Math, English, Science, and Social Studies while simultaneously allowing them to pursue individual interests.

Finally, the high school curriculum should not simply be about achieving standardised results or qualifications. It should be about giving students the opportunity to explore, develop skills, and gain knowledge in areas that are meaningful to them. Curating their curriculum can help to achieve this goal and provide students with a sense of autonomy and independence that prepares them for life beyond the classroom.

To conclude, giving high school students the opportunity to curate their own curriculum is advantageous to both the individuals and society as a whole. This move towards personalised education provides students with greater motivation and engagement, aids the development of vital life skills, informs educational practices, and allows students to embrace a love of learning that transcends the classroom. As such, there is strong evidence to suggest that a curriculum built in partnership between educators and students is the most appropriate path forward for education.
