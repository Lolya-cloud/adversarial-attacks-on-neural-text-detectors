As new teaching models and learning approaches continue to emerge in education systems worldwide, there has been growing interest in allowing high school students to curate their own curriculums. Although this idea may seem daunting to some, I believe that students should be granted the right to personalize their high school curriculum. This essay will briefly outline several reasons why I believe this is essential.

Firstly, it’s a well-known fact that everyone learns differently. While some students are driven by lectures and notes, others prefer visual or hands-on learning approaches. By allowing high school students to construct their curriculum, we can enable them with a unique opportunity to tailor their education in the way that suits them best. Providing them with multiple paths for learning ensures that they have an equitable chance of personal growth in academics.

Secondly, providing space for our future generations to create their high school curriculum encourages accountability and decision-making skills. It'll motivate them to take ownership of the subjects they study and establish a strong sense of agency over their educational journey. This also encourages learners on fostering self-awareness and practicing collaboration within diverse ecosystems.

Furthermore, students’ interests and passions lie at the intersection of possibilities present in school-learner interactions. Authenticity is an important aspect of learning, allowing learners to build connections between existing knowledge and newly acquired information through personal interests develop impeccable attitudes towards understanding subjects better than ever before.

Moreover, creating more leverage on how students learn allows them for mobility across schools – if necessary – without being constrained by arbitrary transfer criteria tied only with certain courses or perceived levels as primary indicators for gauging a student's growth graph across educational institutions.

Finally, by giving teenagers a voice in designing their own curriculum fosters an environment where young people feel heard and valued rather than just mere passive participants in learning they weren't given much choice over.

Some people may argue that having prescribed courses offers uniformity and maintains consistent academic standards across schools. However; this approach may not support all students in achieving maximum academic success or help them prepare for college or university.

In conclusion, students should have the freedom to curate their high school curriculum by choosing the topics that resonate with their interests. This can create opportunities for equitable learning, accountability and decision-making, cultivating deeper connections across subjects, provide more precise indicators of student growth and well-being, helping realize authentic learning experiences. Students will emerge from high school with a wealth of knowledge and skills they are passionate about and proudly own. Implementing such a strategy would entail significant changes to the current educational system; however, it's crucial in creating lifelong learners who will continually thrive in any given environment.
