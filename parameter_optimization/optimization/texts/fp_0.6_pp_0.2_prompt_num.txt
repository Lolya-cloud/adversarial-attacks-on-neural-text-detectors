In our current education system, high school students are given limited control over their academic curriculum. Generally, schools have specific guidelines and requirements that must be followed to graduate. However, there is growing debate surrounding the idea of allowing students to curate their own curriculum. Some argue that this would lead to increased engagement and interest in learning, while others believe it could result in gaps in knowledge and a lack of preparation for postsecondary education.

Those in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that such autonomy would increase engagement and enthusiasm for education. When students have a say in what they're learning, they're more likely to be engaged and invested in the material covered. If students are interested in a particular topic or subject area, they'll be more likely to devote time and effort into learning it thoroughly. This approach may also encourage creativity as students develop new ways to learn the material.

However, opponents argue that too much freedom can lead to gaps in knowledge and difficulty transitioning into postsecondary education or the workforce. Students often lack perspective on what courses will benefit them the most long-term. It's difficult for them to know which topics are foundational building blocks for future coursework or careers.

It's important to find a balance between student autonomy and foundational knowledge requirements when considering whether or not students should curate their curriculum. A good starting point might be offering limited options within core subject fields with an abundance of electives focused on interests.

Additionally, some subjects require specific foundational concepts necessary later on down the line, requiring standardization outside of elective offerings. For example, mathematics requires building blocks laid out over years; English courses involve key literary movements which cannot be miss learned.

Students should actively participate in mapping out their educational experience by selecting from an approved list of trusted resources fitting personal interests within traditional subject lines.

Another aspect that needs attention is tracking student outcomes under this new model compared with non-autonomous classes with consistent curriculum standards. Data would be a necessity to make sure the new system was effective in benefiting the students.

In conclusion, while giving students control over their curriculum has its benefits, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument. Ultimately, finding a balance between freedom and foundational knowledge is key. Perhaps this could be achieved by limiting subject options to essential ones that require standardized learning, while leaving electives strictly under student discretion. This allows for increased engagement and focus on areas of interest while still preparing students for further education and career paths. Overall, education leaders need to consider reforming current curriculum standards at each end of the spectrum more conducive to today's evolving world way out of high school prompting personalized paths towards personal goals and overall educational enrichment.
