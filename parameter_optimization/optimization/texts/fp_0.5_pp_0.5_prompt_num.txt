The high school curriculum is an essential component of the educational system, and it enables students to learn a wide range of subjects and become well-rounded individuals. However, there are debates about whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum or not. The notion of students being able to control what they study in high school might seem daunting, but it can provide numerous advantages.

One argument in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it provides them with greater flexibility and autonomy. With more choices in selecting courses, students get the chance to tailor their academic journey according to their interests and career goals. This would mean that students also become more invested in their studies because they have chosen them themselves.

Moreover, when students get the freedom to pick what they want to learn, they are more likely to be engaged in the classroom. As opposed to taking courses they have no interest in, having the ability to choose classes would allow them to focus on things they are excited about and enjoy learning.

Furthermore, allowing high school students curate their course load would enable them to learn at a pace that's best for them. Everyone learns differently - some learn faster than others while some prefer a slower pacing - which may not always align with a standard or set curriculum plan. Being allowed the freedom allows every student based on their needs and personalities.

On the other hand, a common counter-argument against this proposal is that many teenagers lack sufficient experience or understanding of how education works fully; hence unequipped enough for such decisions-making power.

However, even if it is true that most young students have limited knowledge about curriculum planning or how some subjects can benefit one another later on academically or career-wise - there should still be systems in place like guidance counselor meetings where educators could step-in offer advice give direction for better decision making regarding available options within local requirement guidelines.

In conclusion, allowing school students access over their curriculum provides them with a sense of ownership over their learning, offers greater flexibility to better accommodate different learning styles and paves the way for self-discovery. Of course, while there is still a need for structured coursework in some ways, educators should work hard to lay down ground rules - where students have access to guidance counselors or advisors who can help them map out academic pathways that fit their interests, passions, and goals. Doing so would create more vibrant classrooms filled with excited learners eager to take on the challenges of school life.
