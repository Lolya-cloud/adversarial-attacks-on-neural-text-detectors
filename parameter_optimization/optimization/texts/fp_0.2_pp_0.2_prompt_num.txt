In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in giving high school students greater autonomy in the selection of their own course curriculums. This approach to education has become popular among those who value student independence and creativity. Although some may argue that students lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to curate their own curriculum effectively, I believe that high school students should be allowed to create their own personalized curriculum because it fosters creativity, academic engagement, and enhances the learning experience.

One advantage of having students curate their own high school curriculum is that it promotes creativity and innovation. When students have the power to control their own academic path, they can pursue their interests without feeling restricted. It gives them the well-needed space to engage in creative projects and explore new avenues of thought. Students can select courses that inspire them to think critically and expose them to diverse perspectives on any given subject, which stimulates creative thoughts, imaginations, and independent thinking essential for future success.

Another significant advantage of a personally curated curriculum is that it helps to boost student engagement in academic tasks. Students who have ownership of their education tend to show a higher level of engagement as compared to those who do not have such responsibility. By allowing students to choose what topics they study in-depth, education becomes more meaningful and relevant which increases motivation levels and leads to better outcomes.

Moreover, having the opportunity to create a personal curriculum can enrich a studentâ€™s learning experience. Public schools follow an inflexible structure where a core syllabus is set, often limiting a student's choice and making the learning process more mundane. Personalized curriculum building allows students to discover aspects of their education that are particularly interesting and meaningful to them while developing new skill sets. Students get to tailor each course according to their specific needs and interests leading them towards self-discovery.

Some opponents of this idea argue that insufficient knowledge or experience impedes students' ability to choose curriculums that align with their long-term objectives. However, by providing guidance on what courses to choose, students can develop the necessary skills to make informed decisions that align with their future career aspirations. This approach instills self-development and self-assessment, giving students a sense of responsibility for their academic path and future life goals.

In summary, allowing students to curate their learning experiences is a valuable way of promoting creativity, academic engagement, and enhancing the learning process. Giving students the freedom of choice not only transforms education but also encourages personal enrichment and intellectual development. By personalizing education, schools can help students engage in tasks that interest them, build their strengths, and prepare them for life beyond academia. Thus, school students should be permitted to curate their high school curriculum.
