As society becomes increasingly complex and diversified, schools need to keep up and accommodate a more individualized approach to education. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could be one way of achieving this. However, the issue is controversial as it prompts educators and policymakers to weigh between a sense of discipline and structure versus student agency and autonomy. Regardless, I firmly believe that high school students should have some say in how they educate themselves and choose which subjects they will undertake.

Firstly, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is an acknowledgment of their agency and autonomy as individuals with unique interests and needs. It is well-established that each person’s learning processes are different – some people thrive in science while others excel in humanities. Rather than prescribing an overly-rigid curriculum where what we want or need has no place, by allowing students room to select courses based on specific skills they need or enjoy we can motivate them further. For instance, a student who aspires wish to become a doctor might appreciate the opportunity to select more science-based subjects like biology or chemistry instead of mandatory non-vocational classes like technology studies or basic maths.

Secondly, it will lead to better academic outcomes if students have a hand in choosing which subjects they take. The desire for intrinsic motivation has significant benefits when it comes to achieving better education outcomes. A student who can personalize his/her learning experience is likelier to remain engaged throughout their studies giving them the best shot at excelling academically. More personalized choices through an elective type curriculum might also lead to greater exploration because learners would push beyond the minimum requirements rather than struggle through boring or excessively difficult coursework.

Lastly, incorporating student choice in the process could very easily lead to innovative teaching practices, applied technology, career pathways across multiple employers that take advantage of locally available resources leading from a single discipline into numerous fields particularly for hobbyists only available outside conventional school settings. When options become available outside of conventional schooling like mentorships or community involvement new perspectives often arise making academics easily accessible even beyond the routine, highly standardized schooling structure.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their curriculum offers numerous advantages that should not be overlooked. The learning process gains greater motivation when it’s more personal and choice is involved. Furthermore these initiatives can result in better academic outcomes while also being a positive step towards acknowledging students as capable autonomous learners rather than merely passive recipients of mandated information. While some may still argue against change to the status quo, it seems that there are clear benefits toward transitioning to an elective style curriculum where real-world skills and interests are given more prominence and ultimately could help drive greater exploration and innovation throughout our communities in the future.
