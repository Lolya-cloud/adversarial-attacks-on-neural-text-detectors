Education is a vital part of human development. It is essential in shaping an individual's future and plays a crucial role in preparing students for the challenges of the real world. However, traditional high school education can be rigid, leaving students with a limited range of options. The question arises: should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

For years, schools have followed a set curriculum that caters to a broad range of students. This standardized method of teaching may not always work for everyone as different students have varying interests, learning styles, and career goals. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to a more personalized approach to education. This could result in students taking classes that are more relevant to their passions and develop skills beneficial to their future careers.

Moreover, customization of the curriculum would also enable students to take courses at their pace, without succumbing to external pressure. Like those who require extra practice or assistance with a subject, there are many who excel and require challenging coursework. Without customization, the latter gets bored and unchallenged, resulting in a lack of knowledge seeing no benefit from repetitive pages in textbooks that don't challenge them. With self-customization, students could advance their studies and become more skilled at their book subjects resulting in higher chances of success in college.

Furthermore, schools could tailor the curriculum according to the standards of particular districts and states and comply with state regulations while maintaining a flexible approach to education. In other words, students could select subjects based on what they plan to accomplish in life as opposed to more redundant required courses that do little to enhance the education of students.

However, there are two sides to every coin. One of the arguments against student-curated high school curriculum is that it could lead to procrastination and waste of time. Students may be inclined to choose an easy workload instead of challenging themselves. That is why strict guidelines need implementing with advisors/teacher mentors to help assist in the proper and balanced selection of courses.

Another argument against allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that students who are left to choose the classes of their own volition may do so in a fashion that neglects other subjects than usual. A curriculum that has been carefully created over decades by experienced teachers and administrators caters to a well-rounded learning plan that includes a full range of skills and knowledgebases that are beneficial. Continued supervision and encouragement could assist in the creation of a balance.

In conclusion, there are advantages and disadvantages to providing students with the ability to curate their academic curriculum. A student-curated school curriculum can have many great benefits, including customized studies, enhanced interests, and self-paced advancement, among others. However, there must be appropriate guidelines, advisory support, and accountability to guarantee that the students take advantage of their agency. This approach should ensure a well-balanced education plan that looks beyond just immediate or superficial desires but caters to a future vision over time. As options of post-high school education/military service opportunities will vary and the curriculum setting should provide the best possible foundation for all choices.
