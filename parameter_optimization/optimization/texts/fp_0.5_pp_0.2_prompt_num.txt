Education is an important aspect of everyone's life, and it shapes individuals into productive citizens of society. One crucial aspect of education is high school curriculum or what subjects and topics students study. The current high school curriculum is generally standardized and does not allow for individual student preferences regarding the courses they take.

Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? Yes, they should. Allowing students to choose what they study in high school has numerous benefits, including increased engagement and motivation, greater relevance to their career aspirations, and developing autonomy and critical thinking skills.

Firstly, having the freedom to choose what one studies is likely to increase engagement with the coursework. Students who get a say in what they learn are more likely to enjoy going to classes because they have an active role in the academic process; this translates to better grades as well. Conversely, learners who aren't interested in the courses they are taking will have lower motivation levels and may perform poorly on tests as a result of this disinterest.

Secondly, enthusiasm for courses translates into career aspirations. By allowing students some level of influence over their educational trajectory in high school means that young people can prepare themselves for further education or careers by tailoring their studies towards those fields. If one has a diverse range of interests outside "the core curriculum," then giving them the opportunity to explore these areas will offer insights into potential careers working for companies aligned with those passions.

Finally, by encouraging individualized curricular choices in secondary schools helps create independent thinkers able to contribute posivelytowards society later on. Instead of being coddled through middle and high schools until ready for tertiary institution learning environments which may require independent thought processes during college registration processes when deciding program/major concentrations where raw data statistics may affect acceptance rates creating limitations based off of financial aid or acceptance logistics so people often feel tempted or pressured into entering majors with higher acceptance rates regardless if that field resonates with them. By starting early on developing students' skills in self-determination and responsibility for their academic choices, the higher their chances of enjoying greater success down the road.

In conclusion, high school students should be allowed to choose their courses freely, to increase engagement and motivation, align their studies with potential career paths, and develop autonomy and critical thinking skills. Offering limited course selection alongside mandate or "core curriculum" subjects creates a diversified learning experience while providing real-world career preparation opportunities that can benefit students in the long run. Rather than kids feeling forced into areas they don't want to learn about, maintaining an environment where young learners get choices can help provide excitement in their academic endeavors and a sense of ownership which enhances further learning as well as personal responsibility development too- which these are important factors for developing well-informed independent decision-makers capable of tackling future obstacles head-on!
