Education is the foundation of the future of any society, and it must be designed with great care and attention to meet the needs of students. However, there is a debate in some countries about whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum. Some argue that this will give students greater control over their education while others believe that it could negatively impact their academic progress.

Those who support this idea of a 'student-curated' curriculum believe that students should have greater control over their education. It has been observed that under the current system, students are forced to follow a predetermined path that may not match their interests or strengths. Allowing students to choose their courses will help them explore different areas of interest and discover new passions even if it is not included in the current curriculum. For example, some students may excel in technology but lack knowledge in business management. Therefore, if schools allowed them to pick self-directed courses, they could take courses in coding and computer systems as well as entrepreneurship or marketing tailored to their interests.

Moreover, bespoke curricula will be advantageous in reducing dropout rates because it provides an opportunity for students to engage with subjects that genuinely interest them. Consequently, this will boost the academic achievements of these young citizens. Implementing self-led courses gives children a sense of ownership over their education, which could positively impact their learning attitude towards other subjects.

On the other hand, critics view such an approach as impulsive and reckless believing student-curated programs can have adverse implications on academic attainment. Some grades will depend on basic prerequisites like math and language, required for diverse subjects such as science or literature studies. Consequently, omitting core knowledge can lead to inadequate academic preparation or difficulty gaining admission into a higher education institution.

Additionally, since entire segments of the population might gravitate towards courses with fewer challenges to boost grades for college applications like service learning classes instead of rigorous coursework such as pre-calculus science disciplines, it imparts a disadvantage to the ones who do not have the same access to college application preparation programs, evidently creating more educational disparities.

In conclusion, while many people believe that students should be able to tailor their education, it's ultimately up to policymakers and educators to weigh the pros and cons of such a boon. Although students' self-led curricula can be beneficial unless implemented appropriately, it could cause students to miss critical knowledge needed in preparation for higher education or their future career. It's important to keep students at the forefront of the evolving educational experience while ensuring that they don't undermine their academic achievements. Accordingly, there must be a balance between flexibility and rigor in the educational system to create well-rounded students prepared for future careers and academic ventures.
