Education is a vital element in building a promising future, and high school is a time where students begin to shape their education. However, most high school students find the curriculum confined and limiting. It's because they see the curriculum as uninteresting, irrelevant, or not challenging enough. This has led to the debate on whether students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. In my view, I support the proposition that students should have control over their high school curriculum.

First of all, allowing students to curate their high school education empowers them to take responsibility and ownership of their learning. When students have the freedom to select their preferred courses, it instills a sense of motivation, passion, and interest in the subjects they choose. Students understand that they are not mere receivers but active decision-makers who can create their own academic path. This way, they can focus more efficiently on selecting courses that align with their career aspirations and personal interests.

Furthermore, student-led education fosters a more personalized learning experience. Different students have differing learning speeds, interests, abilities, and talents. Therefore, one standardized curriculum won't suffice the needs of every student. Allowing students to select their courses gives them a personalized experience that caters to their specific needs. For instance, a student who desires to pursue a career in physics can take higher level physics courses while those interested in writing can take courses in creative writing. This way, each student can tailor their academic journey suited to their passion and career objectives.

Moreover, student-curated education promotes academic excellence. By allowing students to take courses that are challenging and intriguing to them, it increases accountability for their academic achievement. They understand that the courses they chose will determine their success and future, thus making them more willing to achieve it. This, in turn, boosts their academic excellence by creating a culture of academic motivation and inspiration.

On the other hand, some might argue that students lack the necessary knowledge and experience to curate their education successfully. However, this is not entirely true. Although some students might require assistance in creating their curriculum, they should be given the independence to make choices. Guidance from teachers, counselors, and parents can help align their interests with their career aspirations. However, allowing them the choice to select courses that resonate with their goals and interests ensures self-driven learning which fosters lifelong skills.

In conclusion, it's paramount to allow high school students to curate their curriculum. It empowers them to take responsibility and ownership of their learning, promotes a personalized education experience, and fosters academic excellence. As such, education stakeholders should consider giving students the freedom to create a high school curriculum that suits their career aspirations, interests, and strengths. By doing so, it'll foster a more passionate and purpose-driven youth with a thirst for life-long learning.
