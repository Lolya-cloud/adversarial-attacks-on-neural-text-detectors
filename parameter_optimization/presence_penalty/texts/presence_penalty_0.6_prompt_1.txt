The death sentence is an age-old method of punishment that is still prevalent in many countries, despite widespread opposition from human rights organizations and activists. While proponents argue that it is a just and necessary mode of punishment for heinous crimes, opponents argue that it is cruel, inhumane, and ineffective in reducing crime rates. In this essay, I will argue that the death sentence should not be implemented globally because it violates the fundamental principle of human rights, has been linked to racial and economic discrimination, and is not an effective deterrent to crime.

Firstly, implementing the death sentence globally is a violation of the fundamental principle of human rights that every human being has the right to live. The right to life is enshrined in various international legal instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The death sentence, therefore, goes against these principles and undermines the value of human life. Moreover, there is an inherent risk in executing an innocent person, as has been shown by various cases of wrongful convictions. For example, in the United States, more than 160 people on death row have been exonerated since 1973. Therefore, to implement the death sentence globally is to take an enormous risk with the lives of innocent individuals.

Secondly, implementing the death sentence globally has been linked to racial and economic discrimination. Studies have shown that people of color and those from low-income backgrounds are more likely to receive the death penalty than their white counterparts with similar crimes. This disparity is evident in various countries worldwide, such as the United States, where more than half of those on death row are Black or Latino. It is undeniable that implementing the death sentence globally perpetuates such inequalities, which violate the principles of equality and fairness.

Thirdly, the death sentence is not an effective deterrent to crime. Various studies have revealed that the threat of the death sentence does not reduce crime rates, nor does it deter criminals from committing crimes. Instead, it is expensive and diverts resources from more effective crime prevention measures. For example, the cost of administering the death penalty in the United States is much higher than that of pursuing a life sentence. Furthermore, countries with lower murder rates, such as Canada and the European Union nations that have abolished the death penalty, demonstrate that it is possible to have a just society without relying on the ultimate punishment of death.

In conclusion, the death sentence should not be implemented globally because it violates the basic human right to life, has been linked to racial and economic discrimination, and is not an effective deterrent to crime. The practice of capital punishment should be replaced by more humane and effective methods of punishing offenders, such as rehabilitation and restorative justice. Governments worldwide should focus their efforts on addressing the root causes of crime and helping communities to create safer societies where every human life is valued and protected.
