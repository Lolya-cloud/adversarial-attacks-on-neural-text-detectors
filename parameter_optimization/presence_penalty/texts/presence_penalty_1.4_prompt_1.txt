The issue of the death sentence is an ongoing debate among policymakers, human rights activists, religious leaders, and legal scholars. The implementation of the death sentence globally has been a subject of controversy for many years. While some argue that it helps reduce crime rates, others contest that it violates fundamental human rights. In this essay, I will provide arguments on both sides of the debate and conclude that the death sentence should not be implemented globally.

On the one hand, proponents of the death sentence argue that it serves as a powerful deterrent to prevent people from committing heinous crimes. This means that individuals who are aware of the death penalty may reconsider engaging in criminal activities, knowing that their actions could lead to irreversible consequences. Furthermore, supporters believe that the death penalty is more cost-effective than life imprisonment since executing prisoners eliminates the need to provide them with long-term healthcare, housing, and sustenance. Moreover, capital punishment guarantees that dangerous criminals do not pose a threat to society, protecting innocent citizens from harm.

However, critics of the death sentence contend that the practice violates fundamental human rights as enshrined in international law. Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person." The imposition of the death sentence violates a person's right to life, leading some opponents of capital punishment to describe it as a form of state-sanctioned murder. Critics also argue that the death sentence is discriminatory and biased against marginalized groups, often resulting in those without financial resources or access to quality legal representation facing disproportional punishment.

Perhaps most importantly, opponents assert that research has shown little evidence to support the claim that the death sentence effectively reduces crime rates. Studies suggest that jurisdictions without capital punishments have similar or lower homicide rates than those that enforce the practice. Additionally, errors occur in the justice system, and innocent people have been wrongfully executed in past cases. Finally, the abolition of the death sentence aligns with the global trend towards promoting human rights and upholding justice by evolving away from punishing prisoners through methods that are seen as barbaric and constituting cruelty.

In conclusion, the debate over the implementation of the death penalty globally continues to be a complex and controversial topic. Regardless of how one views the issue, we should all agree on the need for governments to ensure the maintenance of the rule of law while not violating fundamental human rights. The risks associated with wrongful judgments and the possibility of executing innocent people outweigh any perceived benefits of implementing the death sentence as a means of punishment. Therefore, I argue that the death penalty should not be implemented globally, but instead replaced with other forms of punishment that uphold human dignity and conform to international laws.
