School students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Every student is unique and has different interests and goals for their future. Allowing students to have the freedom to choose certain courses that align with their interests could potentially lead to better overall academic performance and success.

One benefit of allowing students to select some of their own coursework is that it allows them to explore their passions and interests. High school can be very stressful and demanding. Allowing students to have some control over their education and what they are learning can help relieve some of that stress. When students feel more engaged and invested in what they are learning, they are more likely to succeed and have a positive learning experience.

Furthermore, allowing students to have a say in their high school curriculum can also help prepare them for their future. Allowing students to choose courses related to their desired career path can provide them with a head start in developing the skills and knowledge necessary for their future careers. It allows students to gain an in-depth understanding of various subjects, which helps them to make informed decisions when deciding on college majors or career paths. 

Moreover, curating their high school curriculum provides students with a sense of ownership and responsibility over their education. They are given the opportunity to make choices and decisions that will undoubtedly impact their futures. This fosters an environment of independence and accountability, as students learn to manage their time, prioritize their studies and set goals for themselves.

On the other hand, allowing students to decide their coursework may raise concerns regarding students' ability to discern the importance of certain courses and subjects. In some cases, students may have a tendency to pick courses based on convenience rather than necessity or interest. Nonetheless, this issue can be mitigated by the involvement of counselors and educators in guiding students and ensuring that they are meeting all necessary requirements.

In conclusion, high school students should be given the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum. Not only does this approach allow students to explore their interests and passions, but it can also help prepare them for their future careers. Furthermore, it fosters a sense of responsibility and initiative in students, allowing them to take charge of their education and make decisions that will impact their future. Therefore, teachers, counselors, and educators must work with students to ensure that they are making responsible and informed decisions when curating their high school coursework.
