Introduction

The traditional education system follows a structured curriculum that students must undertake throughout their high school years. This approach limits the individuality of each student and sometimes leaves them feeling distant from what they want to achieve in their academic endeavors. For this reason, it is time to evaluate whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Argumentative Essay

There are diverse opinions regarding whether or not high school students should be permitted to create their curriculum. Some educators believe that students cannot handle such an enormous responsibility as selecting their coursework because they lack the expertise required to develop a well-rounded curriculum. Nevertheless, allowing students to plan their curriculum equips them with crucial life skills, responsibilities, and acknowledges that every student's aspirations and educational requirements differ. Here are some reasons why high school students should consider developing their curriculum:

Personalization

Each student attending a secondary school comes from different backgrounds and has specific learning preferences. In most cases, a standard curriculum might not cater to these prerequisites effectively. It can lead to dissatisfaction and disengagement, where students fail to maximize the given opportunities. Allowing students to curate their coursework fosters the creation of personalized plans for learners catering to individual inclinations, which ultimately enhances excitement and motivation towards learning.

Preparation for Higher Education

Every year thousands of high school graduates proceed directly into college or university. Suppose students were allowed to select desired courses in high school. They would learn essential planning and decision-making skills that enable them to succeed later. This opportunity opens room for exploration beyond conventional learning paradigms that dilute creativity, curiosity and intellectual development.

Practical Learning Opportunities

High school courses are often designed mainly around theoretical knowledge devoid of practical application. By empowering students to choose relevant projects, group discussions, presentations and field trips via self-curated curricula, students receive a more comprehensive understanding of concepts learnt during class periods through real-world situations. This method of teaching enhances entrepreneurship, logical thinking, innovation and fosters longevity for knowledge retention.

Improves Student Engagement

As a result of being able to participate in course planning, students acquire quality learning experiences that stimulate their minds. This approach is more significant from an emotional perspective as it improves student-engagement. Henceforth, they might display improved attendance, reduced disciplinary cases and increased student morale across the school community.

Conclusion

The traditional education system has proved rigid at times when it comes to accommodating differences amongst learners. Educators must consider alternate ways to promote inclusion and individual interests while still catering towards mandatory requirements set forth by accreditation bodies. The advantages and value of allowing high-school students to curate their curriculum are unmatched. By enabling young adults with self-directed learning opportunities allows them to focus on areas of necessary personal growth and strengthens skills required beyond basic textbook concepts. Traveling both opportunistic benefits and elevated educational outcomes would be reason enough for educators worldwide to positively consider such study plans.
