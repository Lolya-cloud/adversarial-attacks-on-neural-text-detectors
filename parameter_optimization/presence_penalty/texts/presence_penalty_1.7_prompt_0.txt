Education is the key that unlocks the door to success, and high school education lays a foundation for future success. The high school curriculum plays an important role in shaping students’ career paths. However, many students have different interests, goals, and learning styles that might not be catered to by the traditional high school curriculum. That's why there is a growing debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum or not. In my opinion, I believe that students should be given the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum as it allows them to tailor their education towards their interests, encourages autonomy, and prepares them for further studies.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will enable them to choose subjects that suit their interests, passions, and talents. High school is a critical stage in a student’s life, and it is where a student starts preparing for his/her future. Therefore, it is essential that they get the best of what suits them during this period. If given the choice to select courses based on their interests, students could decide between science-focused courses, humanities-based programs, art classes, music, or dance lessons. This approach allows students to take ownership of their education, increasing their chances of academic success because when individuals learn something they enjoy or are passionate about, they have higher rates of retention and acquisition.

Secondly, allowing students to develop their own personal high school curriculum fosters autonomy in education, freedom of thought, and exploration. Giving students the freedom to design their course content and schedule forces them to think independently, enables problem-solving abilities, and propels innovative thinking, which is required in today’s world. By allowing autonomy in creating educational pathways, students can take responsibility for their decisions and see them through. There is no greater motivator than mastering something you undertook voluntarily, making it reliable in cultivating intrinsically motivated learners.

Finally, being able to curate their curriculum can prepare students for further studies. When selecting college courses, in particular, high-performing students create bespoke academic plans that provide them with a personal roadmap towards the future career they envisage. High schools are supposed to be preparing students for college, and making it easier for them to make choices on what subjects interest them earlier, gives them a better head start in making more informed decisions when deciding which options will lead them along their desired educational path.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school education helps them to develop autonomy, navigate unexplored areas of knowledge and allows them to pick up interests, passions or hobbies along the way - resulting in a more well-rounded education, life experiences outside of stereotypical expectations, and ultimately encouraging a lifelong drive to learn. Students must know the outcome of their decisions as this will also teach them about accountability and how to manage responsibilities – preparing them at an even higher level for college and their careers beyond. Expanding student choice within high school curriculum selection ought to genuinely remain reflective of individual needs, strengths, and perspectives rather than vocational training alone. As educators strive to foster learning environments that support students to cultivate skills required to succeed in today's society, the role of self-determination should never be underestimated, and one means of achieving this is by empowering prudent subject selection from a young age. Ultimately, each and every aspiring learner has a right to direct their pathway towards achievement according to their unique personality, values, and goals, all of which are facilitated and fortified through custom education.
