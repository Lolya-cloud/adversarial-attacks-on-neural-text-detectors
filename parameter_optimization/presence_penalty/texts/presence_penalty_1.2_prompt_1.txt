Introduction:

The death sentence, also known as the capital punishment, is a penalty awarded to individuals who have committed heinous crimes. While some countries all over the world use this punishment as a way of deterring crimes and ensuring justice is upheld, some countries have completely abolished it.

Thesis Statement:

Despite the advancements in human rights and civilized behavior, I believe that the Death Sentence should be implemented globally, but only under strict regulations and with proper checks and balances.

Body Paragraph 1:

One reason why the death sentence should be implemented worldwide stems from the need for justice. In situations where severe crimes are committed by an individual, it may seem that other penalties such as life imprisonment or probationary sentences may not add up to the level of justice required. The death sentence can help deliver the right retribution for such severe crimes. For instance, a terrorist who has killed several innocent children or adults doesn't deserve to live on calculated taxpayers' money and enjoy privileges offered during his or her stay behind bars. Such an individual should face the full consequences of their actions.

Body Paragraph 2:

Another reason why the death penalty should be encouraged includes discouragement of future criminal activities. Seeing people punished severely for capital offenses will deter potential criminals from committing such violent acts. Countries that have implemented the death penalty have lower crime rates compared to countries that haven't. This highlights the efficacy of the policy in keeping society safe.

Body Paragraph 3:

Rehabilitation as a means of correcting behaviors and reforming criminals has been attempted for centuries by criminologists and penal systems across much of the world. However, according to research, prison rehabilitation hasn't helped much in decreasing the rate of crime throughout the world. Moreover, this program requires significant funding and resources, which could be challenging to many developing economies. Capital punishment, therefore, serves as a cheaper and more direct way of punishing offenders that belong to the irremediable category. The death penalty can save resources, ultimately for the betterment of society as other rehabilitation programs could be reformed and funded with the saved money.

Counterarguments:

Although the above reasons justify the implementation of global death penalty incentivizing key factors such as justice and deterrence while at the same time providing financial benefits to countries, opponents can contend that capital punishment violates human rights and that innocent people may be executed without proper judicial process or trial.

However, these arguments are not wholly founded in reality; in fact, many cases have been brought forward where only DNA testing can fully vindicate wrongfully accused prisoners. Governments can accurately follow proper legal channels rather than impulsive trials to increase certainty in decision making, minimize chances of error, and prevent wrongful executions henceforth. That said, misconceptions regarding rightful accusations need to be thoroughly checked to ensure no innocent individual is punished for crimes they never committed.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, is the death sentence necessary? Yes, it is, but only under certain circumstances and implemented globally with proper regulations. While concerns over violating human rights exist, a properly administered capital punishment intends to inflict justice on heinous criminals, discourage future offenders from breaking the law, and potentially provide cost-effective means of crime deterrent. A careful examination of how the policy is implemented can address most concerns, ensuring that the Death Sentence remains effective in maintaining law and order for societies worldwide.
