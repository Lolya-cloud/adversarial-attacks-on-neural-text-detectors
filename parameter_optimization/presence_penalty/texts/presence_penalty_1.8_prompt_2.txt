Physical disability can have a profound impact on a person's life, often making it difficult to access buildings, transportation, and services. Accessible infrastructure is essential for ensuring that all individuals have an equal opportunity to participate fully in society. Despite efforts by governments to improve accessibility, many people with physical disabilities still face barriers in their daily lives. It is therefore imperative that the government do more to enhance accessibility for people with physical disabilities.

Firstly, improving accessibility benefits not only those with physical disabilities but also society as a whole. When more extensive provisions are made to accommodate people with mobility or other physical impairments, it enables them to contribute more effectively to society. By increasing better accessibility to various public places like parks, schools, libraries, and healthcare facilities, it ensures that everyone gets the same chance at employment opportunities, education, social interaction, and overall quality of life regardless of their physical ability. Such inclusivity will empower people with physical challenges, enabling them to explore and enjoy new experiences while undoubtedly contributing positively to their economic and social wellbeing.

Secondly, improved accessibility is morally right and just. Every individual has the right to be treated equally, particularly when it comes to gaining access to necessary services and amenities. A lack of access to basic infrastructures denies people with physical disabilities the fundamental right to freedom., independence and autonomy which make these parts of the society accessible. The provision of equitable accommodations would alleviate any unfair burden carried due to their physical condition and ensure they lead a dignified life deservingly.

Lastly, failure by the government to tackle this issue translates into potential lawsuits against organizations or businesses that engage in discriminatory practices regarding accessibility, which makes the system burdensome, ineffective and expensive. Pursuing legal action may take time and financial resources away from far greater concerns that affect both the subject and the judicial sector. Ensuring adequate accessibility eliminates the need for such proceedings, preserves the moral integrity of government and private institutions, and ultimately embodies the principles of equality upon which society thrives.

In conclusion, it is wholly appropriate and necessary that the government should do more about improving accessibility for people with physical disabilities. By doing so, people can realize their full potential by contributing to social, economic, and political inclusive endeavors without failure, thus leading a prosperous and fulfilling life. Enacting these measures would guarantee inclusion and opportunities for all members of society, regardless of their physical abilities, and create an environment where they feel appreciated, accepted, and valued. So governments must take responsibility and make significant changes in public infrastructure to implement these measures moving forward. Every living person deserves fair chances, especially when it comes to providing for basic necessities like transportation, employment, education, healthcare, and every other aspect of what makes us human and happy. Providing adequate accommodations at zero cost will not only benefit those affected but vastly improve societal functionality as a whole.
