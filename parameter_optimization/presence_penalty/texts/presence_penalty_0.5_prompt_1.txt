The death sentence, commonly known as capital punishment, has been a topic of heated debate for decades. While some people believe that it is a necessary measure in society to deter people from committing crimes, others argue that it is cruel and inhumane. The question then arises: Should the death sentence be implemented globally? In this essay, I will argue against the implementation of the death sentence globally, citing ethical and practical reasons.

From an ethical perspective, the implementation of the death sentence globally is a violation of human rights. Every human being has the right to life, and this right should not be taken away by the government regardless of the crime committed. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits the use of the death penalty unless it is necessary to protect the lives of others. Therefore, implementing the death sentence globally would infringe on this agreement. Additionally, the process of implementing the death sentence is prone to errors, and an innocent person may be put to death unjustly. The risk of putting innocent lives at risk is too significant to be justified by any supposed benefits of implementing the death sentence globally.

Apart from ethical considerations, implementing the death sentence globally is ineffective in preventing crime. Capital punishment does not deter people from committing crimes, as research has shown. Sociologists have found that the death sentence may even increase violent crime rates by gradually decreasing society's belief in the sanctity of human life. Instead of focusing on punishing criminals, efforts should be made to prevent criminal behavior through education, employment, and social welfare programs. Addressing the root causes of criminal behavior is a more effective way of reducing crime than implementing the death sentence globally.

Moreover, implementing the death sentence globally is financially impractical. The cost of implementing the death sentence is higher than that of imprisonment. Legal processes involved in implementing capital punishment are expensive and time-consuming, tying up valuable resources that could be used for other essential needs, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to channel resources into programs that address the root causes of crime rather than into the incarceration of offenders.

In conclusion, the death sentence should not be implemented globally due to ethical and practical reasons. From ethical perspectives, it violates human rights and can have fatal errors. Furthermore, implementing capital punishment does not deter crime and may even increase violent behavior rates. Lastly, implementing the death penalty is financially impractical. In place of focusing on capital punishment, we need to focus on measures that prevent crime and address the root causes of criminal behavior. By doing so, we may attain a just and safer society that respects the sanctity of human life.
