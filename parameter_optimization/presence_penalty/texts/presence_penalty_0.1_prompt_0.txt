In the traditional education system, high school students follow a predetermined curriculum set by the institution. However, in today's world, many students are becoming increasingly involved in their own education and are eager to have more control over the subjects they study. Therefore, it is time we consider the question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the reasons why students should be permitted to curate their high school curriculum is that it will allow them the opportunity to personalize their education. While the current curriculum is comprehensive and aimed at providing students with all-around knowledge, it may not cater to the unique interests and talents of each individual student. By having the power to choose the subjects they want to study, students will have more control over what they learn. As a result, they will be more invested in their education and more likely to become lifelong learners.

In addition, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum provides them with the opportunity to hone their skills and pursue their passions. For example, if a student has a unique talent in a specific subject, allowing them to concentrate on that area will aid them in developing their talent. Rather than constantly being forced to study topics they aren't interested in or excel in, students will be able to choose subjects that energize and inspire them, resulting in increased productivity and better grades.

Another key reason why students should be given the freedom to curate their high school curriculum is that it can contribute to their future job prospects. Tailoring education to an individual's aspirations has a significant role in today's job market. With the job market in constant flux and technology reshaping industries every day, it is imperative that students have the opportunity to gain specific knowledge in alignment with their dream career. This will also mean that high schools will be able to create programs that will not only cater to the needs of their students but also enable them to adjust to the ever-changing job market.

Despite the benefits of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum, there are some concerns. One of the issues is that it may lead to a lack of core skills in essential subjects. Students may be inclined to opt for subjects that interest them, which may not necessarily be important to their future studies or work life. To avoid this, schools can provide their students with a general guideline to ensure they do not deviate too far from their core curriculum.

In conclusion, it is time for us to recognize that high school students should be given the freedom to curate their high school curriculum. By doing so, students will have the ability to tailor their education to their unique needs, interests and aspirations, which will result in a better educational experience for themselves, and create a workforce of innovative thinkers that can adapt to changes in the global economy. Therefore, it is imperative for schools and education authorities to incorporate elements of student choice in their academic approach. It is an essential step towards ensuring a brighter future for ourselves and the next generation.
