The question of whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum is a hotly debated issue. While some argue that giving students more control over their education can lead to greater engagement and better outcomes, others are concerned that such a move could compromise the quality of education received. In this essay, it will be argued that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could be beneficial in numerous ways.

One advantage of this approach is that it enhances student engagement. When students are given a say in what they learn and how they learn it, they are more likely to feel invested in their studies and take ownership of their educational journey. This, in turn, leads to improved motivation, which can translate into better academic performance. Students who feel like they have a voice in their education experience may be more excited about coming to school each day and more eager to participate in discussions and group projects.

Another benefit of allowing students to curate their curriculum is that it allows them to pursue their interests and passions. Not every student will be passionate about all of the subjects that are required for graduation, and for those who are not, compulsory courses can feel like a waste of time. But if students had more flexibility to focus on the topics that interest them most, they would be more invested in their studies and more likely to engage with the material on a deeper level. Furthermore, by pursuing topics that captivate them, students may discover new interests and skills that they can use later in life.

Moreover, having power over their curriculum can also empower students to make informed choices about their future careers and educational pathways. With such autonomy, they can tailor their learning to align with their career aspirations and determine which classes are most relevant to their chosen profession. Proponents of such an approach argue that current curriculums need to be expanded beyond the traditional to incorporate broader knowledge domains, as such will give students many options for finding their place in the rapidly evolving job market.

However, some critics of this concept claim that students are not qualified to make decisions about which courses are essential for a well-rounded education, and usurping such is a form of indulging in frivolities. Furthermore, opponents also argue that students who choose to pursue only their interests might miss out on critical subjects such as math or science, which are essential for many professions.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum can have several benefits, including increased engagement, deeper learning, academic performance as well as empowering them to follow their passions and align their studies with their future aspirations. While there are valid concerns about students ignoring foundational subjects, this does not necessarily strip the significance or potential versatility if the approach is appropriately implemented. Therefore, both teachers and students need to work together to find a balance between student autonomy and core requirements, which might be beneficial in promoting vigorously engaged and informed students equipped for lifelong learning.
