Education is a vital component of our lives, as it forms the foundation for personal growth and professional advancement. It is crucial that students receive relevant educational opportunities, which will enable them to make informed choices, pursue their career goals, and have a meaningful impact on society. However, the traditional education system may not be equipped to offer an entirely inclusive and student-centered curriculum. Thus, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

The answer is yes; school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. School curricula are often rigid and inflexible, intending to impart generic knowledge to all students regardless of their unique interests or passions. Moreover, there might be courses that do not appeal to some students or appear irrelevant to what they want to achieve in their future professions. Allowing students to choose their coursework would increase relevance and engagement and lead to more profound learning experiences.

Allowing students to select their classes would help them establish learning goals and acquire skills relevant to their aspirations. It could target economic and social changes, with learners seeking to equip themselves with life skills such as civic awareness and media literacy, preparing them for the demands of a dynamic economy and 21st-century society. Students who understand the importance of making informed decisions about their curriculum can study further, taking challenging courses, thereby preparing themselves better for higher education programs.

Moreover, this approach would reduce the burden placed on teachers, giving them ample time and resources to improve student performance in selected subjects. Teachers would create programs to provide highly specific teacher-led instruction in agreed-on areas of interest, allowing students to progress at their pace while still acquiring essential content and skills.

Another critical aspect of personalized-curriculum planning is the possibility of accommodating learners with diverse backgrounds, interests, and career aspirations. Some students might prefer pursuing scientific careers, while others might lean towards creative arts, humanities, or engineering. By providing personalized curricula options, we recognize that all students are unique and have different academic needs.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum leads to better student retention rates. Students that have a sense of control over their studies would develop persistence in challenging tasks and have the impetus to remain focused on long-term goals. Expectations for coursework completion, class participation, increased accountability for grades, and graduation expectations increase when students actively partake in developing their entire curriculum.

However, it is crucial to recognize that personalized-curriculum planning does not entirely disregard the value of mandatory courses. The curriculum options available should be intentionally designed so that even essential subjects like math, English, science, or social studies form the base. There must be protocols present to ensure standards are met, such as demonstrating competency or satisfying mandatory requirements for higher-education readiness.

In conclusion, school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum to enhance relevance, engagement, learning, and student performance and prevent missed opportunities in careers and vocational fields. Allowing learners the freedom to select classes they want enables customization of educational objectives around specific individual goals. More diverse programs can be developed to encourage enrollment and improve retention rates while still maintaining best practices and foundational courses necessary for graduation and post-secondary readiness. Personalized-curriculum planning acknowledges the uniqueness of every student's academic journey and plays an instrumental role in providing future-focused education suitable to students' needs.
