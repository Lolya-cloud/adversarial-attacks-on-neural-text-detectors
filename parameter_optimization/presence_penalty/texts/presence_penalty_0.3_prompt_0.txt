Curriculum planning has always been a contentious issue for educators and policy makers. While some argue that a structured curriculum is the most effective way to ensure academic success, others believe that students should have the freedom to choose their course of study. Given the importance of high school curriculum in shaping studentsâ€™ academic and career futures, it is crucial to consider whether school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum.

First and foremost, allowing students to choose their courses would enable them to take ownership of their education, leading to improved engagement and academic success. Research has shown that when students are given a say in their learning, they become more motivated and engaged in their studies. They are also more likely to take an active role in their own learning. This ownership fosters a sense of autonomy, which, in turn, leads to a greater sense of responsibility for their academic progress.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their curriculum can help them to pursue their passions and interests, leading to a greater sense of fulfillment and enjoyment. Students who are passionate about certain subjects tend to perform better academically in those subjects. Allowing students to design their own course of study would therefore ensure that they are more likely to find joy and meaning in their educational experience, which would ultimately result in a more positive academic experience for these students.

Thirdly, students creating their high school curriculum would empower them to make choices that are tailored to their future aspirations. Every student has different post-secondary goals, and their curriculum should reflect those goals. For instance, a student interested in pursuing a career in science may choose to focus on science courses, while a student interested in arts may select courses that align closely with their interests. Providing pupils with the ability to tailor their high school curriculum enables them to focus on the specific skills needed for their future partners and careers.

However, some people may argue that students would not have the necessary background knowledge to make informed decisions about their academic future. This argument is not entirely valid. In fact, many students have a well-considered plan of how they would like to proceed with their education. By providing guidance and mentorship, educators can work with students to develop a curriculum that aligns with their goals.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has various benefits, including greater engagement, personalised learning, and future-oriented thinking. Although there may be challenges in implementing such a reform, it is essential for educators, policy makers, and parents to recognize that students have a unique perspective on their education. Empowering them to choose what they study and personalise their education can lead to benefits that go beyond academic success. Students will become more motivated and engaged in their academic journey, and will gain important life skills that will benefit them long after they leave the confines of formal education. Therefore, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum should be an essential consideration in educational planning.
