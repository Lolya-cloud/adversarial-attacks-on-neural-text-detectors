In today's educational system, students are often frustrated with the lack of control they have over their education. While some schools allow students to choose a few classes or electives, the majority of curriculums are predetermined by administrators and teachers. This leaves little room for individual expression or interest.

Therefore, I strongly believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Allowing students to have a say in their education not only increases academic engagement but also promotes independence and self-motivation.

One of the primary benefits of student-curated curriculum is increased academic engagement. When students are given the freedom to choose courses that interest them, they are more likely to stay motivated and engaged in their studies. This, in turn, can lead to better grades, higher test scores, and an overall sense of pride in one's academic accomplishments.

Furthermore, student-controlled curriculum encourages independence and self-motivation. By taking charge of their own education, students develop important skills like critical thinking, decision-making, and time management. These are all valuable qualities that translate beyond the classroom and into the workforce.

Some may argue that allowing students to curate their own curriculum could lead to a lack of structure and organization. However, this argument does not hold up under close examination. Students would still have to meet certain requirements and guidelines established by the school, ensuring that they receive a well-rounded education.

Another concern may be that students could choose too many "easy" classes or neglect core subjects. But if the high school curriculum was curated by each student, there would be a greater likelihood that students would choose courses that align with their future aspirations or interests.

Moreover, in the digital age, it has become easier than ever for students to research and evaluate prospective courses and universities. This trend in online content also makes it possible for students to enhance their skillset through supplementary courses, practice tests, webinars, and workshops. Using the vast resources available to them, students can ensure they are qualified for their desired career or field of study in higher education.

In conclusion, it is essential for schools to allow students to curate their high school curriculum. The benefits of student-selected courses are too significant too ignore, and educators owe it to their students to give them control over their own education. Ultimately, this will lead to greater academic engagement, independence, and a more productive workforce.
