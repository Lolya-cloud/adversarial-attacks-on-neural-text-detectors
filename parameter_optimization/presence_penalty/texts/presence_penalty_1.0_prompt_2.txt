Physical disabilities are a significant challenge that many people face in their daily lives. The government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities because it is the right thing to do, and it is essential for creating an inclusive society.

Firstly, the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities because it is the right thing to do. People with physical disabilities have the same rights as any other citizen in a country. They deserve equal opportunities, equal access to public spaces, and equal treatment. It is not right that someone with a disability cannot participate in society fully because of inadequate infrastructure. Therefore, the government has a responsibility to ensure their needs are met.

Secondly, making infrastructures accessible for people with physical disabilities will help create an inclusive society. When spaces such as public transportation, buildings, and pavements are inaccessible to people with disabilities, they are excluded from the mainstream society. This exclusion harms their social and economic well-being by making them less able to take part in cultural events, work, and education. Improving accessibility would enable those with disabilities to participate equally in all activities enjoyed by everyone else, reducing discrimination and increasing inclusion in society.

Thirdly, it makes good business sense to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities. About 15% of the world's population live with some form of disability, but this group represents an enormous market segment that is often neglected. Companies can benefit from improving accessibility by fulfilling the needs of disabled customers, who include elderly people and families with prams. By providing more facilities for people with disabilities, the government can encourage businesses to develop products and services aimed at this segment. For instance, curb cuts, which were initially designed for wheelchair users, now benefit parents with strollers.

Finally, improvements in technology mean cost should be less of a barrier for accommodating those with physical disabilities. These days, many solutions can be achieved at a reduced price point due to advances in technologies such as 3D printing and automation. Therefore, the government should actively invest in research to make technology more accessible to disabled people.

In conclusion, it is crucial for the government to ensure that people with physical disabilities are not left out of society due to inadequate infrastructure. They have the same rights as everyone else and deserve the opportunity to participate equally in public life. By improving accessibility, society benefits from increased access to employment opportunities, improved social interaction, and creates equal citizenry for all people. Therefore, the government should invest further in improving accessibility facilities and increase investment in innovative technological solutions where feasible. This move will indicate that the government values equal treatment of its citizens.
