The issue of accessibility for people with physical disabilities has been a long-standing one, often neglected by governments and policymakers around the world. A physically disabled person may face numerous barriers to education, employment, transportation, and healthcare. While some progress has been made, much remains to be done. The question that arises is whether or not the government should take action to improve accessibility for these communities.

There are several arguments in favor of the government doing more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities. Firstly, it would help reduce discrimination against them. Physical disability places an individual at a disadvantage when it comes to participating in society fully, which means that physical barriers must be removed so that they can have equal access to resources like schools, jobs, health care, and public spaces. Government programs, policies, and regulations can aid this process.

Secondly, improving accessibility for persons with physical disabilities can also lead to economic benefits. It will enable them to participate fully in the workforce, contribute to the economy, and receive a fair wage. This will increase their income, boost their purchasing power, and stimulate demand for products and services. Accessibility measures could also create jobs and businesses catering to people with disabilities. These factors contribute positively to the general welfare of the country.

Thirdly, improving accessibility would ensure compliance with international human rights standards. According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, states must take all appropriate measures to ensure full accessibility in the built environment, transportation, information, and communication technologies for persons with disabilities. Therefore, every government has a responsibility to provide its citizens with equal opportunities to participate fully in social life.

On the other hand, there are counterarguments to be considered. Depending on how exacting the legislation is, creating accessibility measures might incur substantial costs. Individuals and organizations that own buildings, transport equipment, websites, and mobile applications must comply with them, often requiring costly retrofitting procedures. However, the cost of not doing so may be higher, such as legal fees and reputational harm from lawsuits for non-compliance with accessibility standards.

Another counterargument is that improving accessibility might be seen as preferential treatment on behalf of people with disabilities. However, this view is flawed since providing individuals with disabilities equal opportunities is a matter of social justice that benefits everyone by reducing discrimination. The intentionality behind these laws is to accommodate those who face challenges that others do not consider, to ensure everyone has equal access to the same opportunities and resources.

In conclusion, while the government's responsibility to improve accessibility for persons with physical disability may come at a cost in terms of time and money, it also brings economic, moral, and legal advantages to society. Discrimination against people with disabilities and exclusionary practices devalues their contribution to society and deprives us of their gifts. All countries must invest in accessibility measures and break down barriers for disabled persons to make progress towards inclusion, equality, and human rights.
