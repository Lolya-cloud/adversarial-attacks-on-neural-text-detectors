In today's world, education is one of the essential aspects of life. In most countries, the primary and secondary education system is structured in a way where a set curriculum is followed by students in schools. This usually entails study modules, mandatory subjects, and specific exams that students have to take. However, there has been a growing debate on whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. I strongly believe that students should have the freedom to create their curriculum and customize it to their interests.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would provide them with greater flexibility and individuality options. By having students pick and choose classes from a catalog of courses, they can tailor their high school experience to their specific needs. This would allow students to pursue their interests and develop their skills further, which ultimately increases their chances of success in the future.

Secondly, alternative voices and perspectives have always played a pivotal role in innovation and creativity. Giving a voice to students' in the creation of their educational paths could lead to new ideas and innovations. It would mean that students could suggest courses that have not been offered before or that are unusual or innovative.

Thirdly, students are more likely to be motivated and invested in a subject when they have selected it themselves. A student who has selected the courses they are taking is more likely to engage and work harder than someone who has been told to study specific classes. By curating their curriculum, students become active participants in their learning process, and this boosts their confidence and self-esteem as they take charge of their educational path.

To counter one of the critical arguments against this proposal, people often argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would lead to an inconsistent and fragmented educational program. Kids can pick only the courses they are interested in and neglect the foundational classes they must take to have a well-rounded education. However, this argument only considers the negative aspects of a student-driven curriculum. It can be addressed by creating a program that categorizes courses into essential core curricula and elective courses. This ensures every student gets the foundational knowledge they need.

In conclusion, it is imperative to build an education system that centers on the students' interests and motivates them to learn. Every child is unique, and their interests differ; no single rigid educational program can satisfy them all. Students should have the freedom to curate their high school curriculum to suit their passions, career aspirations, and life goals. This would ultimately create a more innovative, creative and motivated generation of learners, and they will be better off for having had the chance to shape their educational paths and, by extension, their futures.
