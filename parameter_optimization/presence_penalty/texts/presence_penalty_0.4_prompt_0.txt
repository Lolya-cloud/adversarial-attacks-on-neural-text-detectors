The issue of school students being allowed to curate their high school curriculum is a hotly debated one. While some argue that it would provide a tailored learning experience for each student, others contend that it would lack the necessary structure and guidance required for a well-rounded education. I believe that students should be given the opportunity to contribute to their high school curriculum, but with appropriate safeguards to ensure their learning is both enriching and challenging.

Firstly, granting students the freedom to curate their own high school curriculum would allow them to choose subjects that align with their interests and passions. This approach could significantly improve student engagement, motivation, and achievement in high school. For instance, if a student is interested in film-making, they may want to pursue more courses on film or even organize extracurricular activities related to film. This kind of personalized education would enable students to explore and refine skills in areas that they are genuinely intrigued by. Ultimately, this autonomy would help translate into better academic results for the student as they would have more ownership over their own learning journey.

However, it is important to address the concern regarding the lack of structure in this approach. It is true that students can be susceptible to making poor choices regarding the courses they pick if given too much freedom. For example, a student might choose to study only sports-related courses and ignore fundamental subjects such as mathematics. Therefore, to effectively curate a high school curriculum, students must be provided with proper guidance and support from their school advisors. Advisors could assist students to identify their strengths and weaknesses and guide them on how to select courses that will contribute to intellectual and personal development. This would provide the necessary structure and support while still ensuring that students have the chance to shape their own education.

Another critical factor to consider is the practicality of this approach. Schools would need to have the resources and flexibility to accommodate a range of student course choices. This could be achieved through a combination of online courses, electives, and student-led extracurricular activities. The school could also periodically evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of student-selected courses against academic standards. Schools could adopt a flexible approach to curriculum planning that considers students' preferences while still ensuring comprehensive coverage of essential subjects.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has the potential to engage and inspire students and create a more personalized learning experience. However, implementing such an approach requires a careful balance between academic rigour and individual expression. By collaborating with school advisors and carefully planning the curriculum, schools could create an environment that allows students to shape their own education while still providing them with the necessary foundation for personal growth and academic success. Therefore, I strongly believe that schools should consider giving students more control over their high school curriculum.
