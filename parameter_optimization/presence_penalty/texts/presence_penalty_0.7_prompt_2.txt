Accessibility is an essential aspect for ensuring that every individual can enjoy and participate in the society. Unfortunately, people with physical disabilities often face numerous barriers that limit their capabilities to access public facilities like buildings, transportation services, communication channels, and other essential services. As such, the government has a responsibility to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their physical abilities, can access public spaces and enjoy full participation in society.

Firstly, the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities because it is a fundamental human right. Every human being should have equal opportunities and rights within their society. The government has an obligation to create inclusive societies where everyone can find and use the available resources without discrimination. Physical exclusion is a form of prejudice that disadvantages people with disabilities, denying them equal rights and opportunities to participate fully in their communities. Therefore, enhancing the accessibility of public areas will create a level playing field for those with physical disabilities and promote an inclusive society.

Secondly, improving accessibility for people with physical disabilities can help to boost the economy. People with disabilities often find it challenging to secure employment opportunities mainly due to the lack of accessible infrastructure. By creating universal designs with features that cater to individuals with disabilities, businesses will have a more significant chance of attracting customers who previously struggled to access public services and facilities. Providing additional support and promoting inclusivity will not only boost the economic development of the country but also assist people with disabilities to become independent, productive, and self-sufficient citizens.

Thirdly, while the government has already taken measures to improve accessibility, there is still much more work that needs to be done. For example, many buildings and infrastructures still lack wheelchair ramps, audio-visual aids, tactile warnings, and other necessary features. Train stations, bus terminals, and airports often pose problems for people with disabilities, making it difficult for them to access public transport. Moreover, digital platforms and media channels continue to present challenges for people with disabilities, especially those who are visually impaired. Consequently, governments need to provide these essential services and policies that cater to the special needs of individuals with disabilities to promote their full inclusion in society.

Some individuals may argue that promoting accessibility often comes at a high cost, which may be unrealistic, given the high levels of poverty and unemployment in many countries globally. However, we cannot justify denying people with physical disabilities equal rights through segregation or leaving them out of everyday activities due to the cost of implementing accessibility measures. The government can mitigate this by partnering with non-governmental organizations and the private sector to reduce costs and find innovative ways of implementing accessibility policies and projects.

In conclusion, the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with disabilities to promote inclusivity, boost the economy, and fulfill fundamental human rights. While some measures have already been taken, more work needs to be done to ensure that every individual has equal access to essential public services and facilities. By creating universal designs that cater to individuals with disabilities, governments can establish an inclusive society that promotes equality and dignity for all its citizens. Ultimately, it is the right thing to do.
