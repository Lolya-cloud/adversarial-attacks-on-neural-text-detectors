The death sentence is a highly controversial issue that has been debated for many years. There are various factors that prompt people to take sides on either implementing it globally or refraining from it entirely.

One of the main arguments in support of the global implementation of the death penalty is its effectiveness as a deterrent for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, treason, and espionage. Advocates argue that since those who commit such heinous crimes tend to be recidivists, giving them this ultimate punishment can prevent others from engaging in similar acts due to fear of facing the same fate. Moreover, there is evidence from several countries that have successfully implemented the death penalty like China and Singapore that support the efficacy argument.

Another reason may be that some societies believe that certain offenses merit capital punishment because they breach moral and ethical codes. In cultures where honor and respect for human life are viewed as paramount values, supporters assert the importance of taking extreme measures necessary to maintain the sanctity of life, even if it entails killing a convicted killer. This might explain why the majority of individuals seeking capital punishment across the world are from religious backgrounds.

On the other hand, opponents of the death penalty question whether the infliction of severe punishment outweighs the benefits gained from punishing criminals. All humans make mistakes but retribution through killing creates no room for error. Situations related to wrongful convictions in which innocent people were sentenced to execution occur frequently and can result in irreversible consequences. Once somebody has been executed, it's impossible to correct a mistake; thus putting someone's life into jeopardy goes against one of our fundamental rights as living beings.

Moreover, human rights organizations condemn capital punishment and consider it inhumane. Critics argue that killing any sentient being promotes neither justice nor moral values. Everyone deserves humane treatment regardless of their actions. The right to life is unique and cannot be deprived unless it's protecting the larger society in cases of self-defence. By contrast, the death penalty is a punishment handed out by people who believe they have the right to kill in peace because of their privilege and authority.

In conclusion, whether or not to implement the death sentence globally has been grounded in opposing sides since time immemorial. Nevertheless, with its gruesomeness, its purported efficacy as a deterrent is overshadowed by the cost of wrongful convictions and violation of fundamental human rights. Instead of capital punishment, alternative criminal system reforms should be considered that focus on prevention, rehabilitation, restitution, and community reintegration for criminals. Ultimately, the fact that someone can walk free after committing terrible crimes makes them lucky but taking away their life through execution does precisely nothing moral or ethically commendable. Therefore, societies must ask themselves if the use of the death penalty aligns with their core values and what sort of statement it will make about their society.
