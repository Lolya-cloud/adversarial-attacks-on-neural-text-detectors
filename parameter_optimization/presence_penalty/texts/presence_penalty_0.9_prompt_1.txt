The death sentence, also known as capital punishment, has always been a controversial issue in global legal systems. The act of taking someone’s life as a form of punishment is a heavily debated topic. While some believe that it should be implemented globally due to its deterrence effect and the idea of justice being served, others argue that it should be abolished altogether due to its flaws, ethical concerns, and possible risks of innocent people being sentenced to death.

Proponents of the death sentence believe that it serves as a strong deterrent against crime. They argue that the fear of receiving the death penalty would discourage potential criminals from committing heinous offenses. Additionally, supporters often argue that implementing the death sentence is a way to bring justice to victims and their families for the harms inflicted upon them. By eliminating the culprit responsible for the crime, such individuals believe that the community can feel safer and move on from the traumatic experience.

However, opponents of the death sentence have valid reasons to argue that it should not be implemented globally. Firstly, death penalty laws can be prone to errors and biases that can result in wrongful convictions. Innocent people have previously faced executions before the realization of mistakes that led to their wrongful convictions occurred. Studies provide compelling evidence that there is no foolproof method or system of administering death sentences appropriately. While governments and courts strive to create safeguards through trials and appeals, wrongful convictions have still occurred, and lives have been lost to mistakes or prejudices.

Secondly, the implementation of the death penalty raises ethical concerns regarding the sacredness of human life. Capital punishment opposes the right to life stated by some religious and philosophical beliefs and values. Moreover, the death sentence grants the government power to take away citizens’ lives; this seems unconstitutional and morally wrong to many.

Moreover, proponents' argument of the deterring effect of the death sentence is flawed. Research shows that countries where the death sentence has been abolished did not experience an increase in violent crime rates. Evidence supports the idea that optimal crime prevention is achieved through investing in education, resources, and opportunities in society.

In conclusion, the death sentence's implementation globally remains a highly debated issue with no clear consensus. However, evidence offers compelling justifications why it should be abolished. The risk of wrongful conviction due to human error or bias undermines the justice system's integrity. The ethical concerns raised by taking away someone’s life cannot just be brushed off lightly. Also, available research shows that the death sentence is not adequately deterring crime significantly. Therefore, governments should focus on creating safer and more habitable communities, emphasizing rehabilitation rather than the death penalty as an exemplary punishment for the perpetrators.
