The death penalty has been a topic of debate for centuries, with some arguing that it's cruel and inhumane punishment while others claim that it's necessary for deterring major crimes. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, there is no denying that the death sentence is still being implemented in various parts of the world. However, the question remains whether this controversial practice should be used globally or not.

One of the primary arguments in support of implementing the death penalty worldwide is the belief that it serves as an effective deterrent for potential criminals. Proponents of capital punishment suggest that by giving severe consequences to heinous crimes such as murder rate would decrease over time. Although this claim may seem plausible at first glance, research does not necessarily support it. Several studies conducted on states within the US show little meaningful correlation between the application of this penalty and reducing crime rates. Thus, it can be said that there is insufficient empirical evidence to support the notion that capital punishment reduces criminal activities.

Moreover, many believe that the death penalty violates human rights and its usage contradicts moral standards. Every person has inherent dignity, and the concept of intentionally taking another’s life for justice conflicts with fundamental notions of personal freedom and sovereignty. Furthermore, racial bias often plays a role in the implementation of the death penalty, resulting in wrongful convictions and discriminatory outcomes. This kind of internal discrimination within the system leads to unjust rulings, which could lead to further friction and issues down the line.

Furthermore, recent breakthroughs in forensic sciences reveal numerous cases where individuals were wrongfully convicted and put to death. Errors by investigators or judges may lead to the conviction of innocent people. Implementing policies that result in irrevocably ending someone's life signifies a significant responsibility must be handed over to institutions and the government. Mistakes made under such circumstances have unfathomable implications for one's family, friends and innocents who have suffered due to faulty judicial practices.

In contrast, abolishing the death penalty worldwide does not equate to the non-punishment of severe crimes. Many developed countries have alternative measures such as life imprisonment or restrictive community orders that accomplish justice without ending another’s life deliberately. Using such solutions will limit court-related costs while still ensuring society is safe from those who could pose a threat.

In conclusion, the death sentence is one of society's most sensitive issues and warrants further debate. However, when examined critically, it is evident that its application contradicts moral principles, lacks sufficient empirical support in crime reduction, and may lead to wrongful convictions and executions. Therefore, implementing effective alternatives to capital punishment would be more reflective of modern morality, particularly with regard to human rights. Consequently, we recommend the abolishment of this controversial practice for social welfare and personal freedom.
