The education system is currently undergoing changes that aim to make it more flexible and empower students in shaping their academic paths. One of the measures gaining traction is allowing high schoolers to curate their curriculum partially or entirely. While some educators argue that a standardized approach is necessary for ensuring comprehensive learning, others support the idea of student-driven curriculums as an effective way to boost motivation and enhance individualized learning. This essay argues that school students should indeed have the freedom to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to determine which courses to take and the order in which they study them can foster intrinsic motivation, leading to better academic outcomes. As Dweck (2000) notes, individuals motivated by inherent interest are likely to persist longer, perform better, and experience greater satisfaction than those motivated by external factors like grades or rewards. A student who thoroughly enjoys mathematics, for instance, would be more likely to excel and derive utility from taking advanced math courses instead of being forced to take other subjects that hold no significance to them.

Secondly, personalized learning has become a trendy concept in education, mainly since it accounts for the varying abilities, interests, and needs of students. Educationalists contend that engagement with subject matter through activities that resonate with individuals' knowledge of themselves produce a deeper learning impact. Allowing students to tailor their studies enhances their senses of ownership and relevance. Such a sense motivates learners to delve deeper into the subject's details and solve complex problems rigorously. Furthermore, when students participate in decision-making regarding what they want to learn, it fosters empathy and self-awareness and enhances their attitudes towards learning.

However, opponents claim that enforcing rigid curricula emphasizes vital aspects of character development, heightening school spirit and providing early exposure to various disciplines. They also affirm that sticking to predetermined curricula provides a level playing ground that ensures comprehensive education regardless of the student's cognitive aptitude. Unfortunately, this view overlooks that standardized curricula disadvantage slower learners or students that require specialized forms of instruction. It also fails to account for how the lack of individual choices and personalized curriculum may lead to disengagement, which is likely to indicate less effective learning.

Therefore, educational programs should incorporate tailored learning by stimulating intellectual curiosity and autonomy through different spheres of development. Pupils who think acutely are more adaptive in circumstances where they can determine a preferred option within reasonable constraints. The approach prepares them adequately, not only for reflective thinking but also as active citizens competent enough to make informed decisions. Furthermore, when students actualize their potentials, it fosters confidence, hence better interpersonal relations with peers and adults. Consequently, empowered graduates have better employability prospects since they possess the skills needed in today's workplace.

In conclusion, allowing high schoolers to tailor their coursework empowers them to take control of their learning experience and enhance their academic performances. A student-driven curriculum gets pupils eager about learning subjects that interest them and adapts to their unique needs, thereby creating lifelong learners. Therefore, educators ought to come up with creative strategies to encourage flexible curricular approaches by balancing student-centeredness and uniformity while preserving quality and consistency in their desired outcomes.
