Accessibility is a fundamental right for every human being and should be guaranteed for everyone irrespective of their physical ability. Despite the progress made over the years, there is still a long way to go in creating a world that is fully accessible to people with disabilities. Governments all over the world have made efforts towards improving accessibility, but it is essential for them to do more to accommodate people with physical disabilities.

One of the primary roles of the government is to ensure that all citizens have equitable access to essential public services, amenities, and facilities. Improving accessibility should be a top priority for any government to guarantee that people with physical disabilities are not left out. Accessibility is an important aspect of inclusiveness as it significantly impacts the quality of life for disabled people.

Although some measures have been taken to improve accessibility, such as ramps, grab bars, wheelchair-friendly buildings, and accessible transit systems, it is simply not enough. Many public buildings are still not entirely accessible, particularly those that have been built for decades. Older buildings can't be easily dismantled and replaced. Some modifications may be costly; however, this shouldn't be a basis for neglecting disabled individuals. The government needs to invest more resources in retrofitting older infrastructure and make sure that new ones meet the highest standards of accessibility. It is essential to note that while these measures are expensive, they will pay off in the long run by guaranteeing equity and inclusiveness to all citizens.

In addition to improving existing infrastructure, the government should also strive to make new structures more disability-friendly. This would require that accessible design be incorporated into every earlier stage of development plans. All contractors and engineers should be trained on how to include disability and accessibility in their designs. When designing public spaces, they should be done in such a way that they're user-friendly for people of different kinds of disabilities. Additionally, governments could set up guidelines and requirements for ensuring that new public buildings are able to provide adequate facilities and amenities for people with disabilities.

Furthermore, the government can improve accessibility by providing incentives to businesses who promote accessibility and discourage those that neglect it. This could include offering tax credits to encourage renovation of public spaces such as sidewalks, railway stations, airports, etc., to make them wheelchair accessible. The government could also provide educational and informational opportunities for businesses on the advantages of embracing universal design practices or incentives for developers to construct structures that are disability-friendly. By incentivizing accessibility, it will result in the creation of more inclusive environments, making a significant impact on the entire community.

In conclusion, it is clear that governments need to do more to improve accessibility. Accessible infrastructure is not only beneficial for disabled individuals but also has wider benefits for the entire community. For a country to be truly inclusive and fair, the government needs to ensure that every individual, irrespective of their physical ability, is afforded equal opportunities and access to public services, facilities, and amenities. Investing in greater accessibility is not only morally responsible but will also have significant economic benefits by ensuring that everyone can fully participate in society. Therefore, the government must take more measures to improve accessibility, both through retrofitting existing infrastructure and making sure new ones meet the highest standards of inclusiveness.
