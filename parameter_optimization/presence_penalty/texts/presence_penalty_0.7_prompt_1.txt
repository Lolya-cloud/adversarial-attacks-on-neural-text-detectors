The issue of whether the death sentence should be implemented globally is one that has been longstanding. Across different nations of the world, debates have been ongoing concerning this controversial topic. While some advocate for its imposition on hardcore criminals and offenders who pose a significant risk to society, others hold that it is a barbaric practice that should be abolished. This essay presents an argumentative position against the imposition of the death sentence worldwide.

One of the main reasons why imposing the death penalty globally should be avoided is the possibility of erroneous convictions. Recent history has proven that wrongful convictions are relatively common in many nations. Often, the justice system in certain countries could be affected by corruption and factors such as discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status. In cases where someone is wrongfully sentenced to death, there is no chance of reparations. Once a person is executed, there is no going back, even if it turns out that they were innocent. This means that any flaws in the legal process could lead to devastating consequences.

Another critical reason why the death penalty should not be imposed globally is related to morality concerns. The death sentence is a barbaric practice that negates basic human rights. Executing any individual prevents them from ever having the opportunity to reform or make amends for their actions. Even though some hard-liners within some societies may argue that the life of a murderer is worth ending, the cycle of violence always leads to more violence in the end. Additionally, government officials who support the death penalty do not necessarily regard human life as valuable.

Furthermore, imposing the death penalty could fail to achieve its ultimate goal of reducing crime rates globally. Many studies that have examined the use of the death penalty have risen with mixed results. Some proponents have argued that it acts as a deterrent to serious crime; however, research does not support this view. On the contrary, there is evidence to suggest that countries that have legalized capital punishment have higher crime rates than those that haven't. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the viewpoint that the death penalty satisfies a human need for revenge.

Finally, there is a concern that the death penalty could create a culture of violence worldwide. The justice system relies on the maintenance of order and the social contract between citizens and the government. Capital punishment inherently requires the use of violence to achieve its end goal. This means that such decisions sow the seeds of violence in society, promoting it as a viable solution to resolving conflicts. This might lead to people using any means to resolve disputes rather than peaceable means.

In conclusion, the death sentence has been a contentious issue worldwide for generations. However, imposing it globally might not represent the best solution to the problems facing modern society. Its implementation carries the risk of erroneous convictions, negates basic human rights, fails to achieve its ultimate objective of reducing criminal activities, and promotes a violent culture. These reasons present a compelling argument against the imposition of the death penalty globally. Therefore, instead of advocating for its widespread adoption, countries should reconsider alternative solutions that enable people to learn from their mistakes and work towards reintegration into society.
