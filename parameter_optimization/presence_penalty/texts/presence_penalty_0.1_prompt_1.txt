The death penalty has been a topic of debate for many years, with some countries choosing to abolish it while others continue to implement it. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, but ultimately, the death sentence should not be implemented globally.

Firstly, the death penalty is irreversible, meaning that if someone is wrongly accused and sentenced to death, there is no way to undo the mistake. There have been cases in history where innocent people were executed for crimes they did not commit. In 2014, for example, Glenn Ford was released from death row in Louisiana after serving 30 years for a murder he did not commit. The possibility of executing an innocent person is an unacceptable risk, and therefore, the death penalty should not be implemented anywhere.

Secondly, the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for crime. In many countries where the death penalty is still in place, crime rates remain high. According to Amnesty International, in 2019, countries where the death penalty is still implemented executed at least 657 people. However, in countries where the death penalty is not an option, such as Canada and France, crime rates compared to countries who do implement the death penalty are low. Research has shown that other factors, such as education, poverty reduction, and mental health services, have a greater impact on reducing crime rates.

Thirdly, the application of the death penalty is often biased and discriminatory. The justice system is fallible, and biases and prejudices can influence the decisions of judges and juries. For example, race plays a significant role in sentencing. In the United States, people of color are disproportionately sentenced to death. The death penalty is almost exclusively applied to people who have killed white victims and not to those who have killed black victims. These racial disparities in the application of the death penalty are unacceptable and should not be tolerated anywhere.

Finally, the death penalty is a violation of human rights. The right to life is a fundamental human right, and the death penalty goes against this right. The United Nations has called for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, stating that it is a cruel, inhumane, and degrading punishment. The death penalty violates the prohibition against torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, recognized in international law.

In conclusion, the death sentence is not an acceptable form of punishment in any society. Its irreversible nature, lack of effectiveness as a deterrent, discriminatory application, and human rights violations make it a barbaric and outdated form of punishment. Instead, governments and societies should work towards creating effective crime prevention strategies that address the root causes of criminal behavior. Education, poverty reduction, and access to mental health services are just a few examples of the measures that can be taken to reduce crime rates. The death penalty should never be implemented globally, as it violates the most basic human rights.
