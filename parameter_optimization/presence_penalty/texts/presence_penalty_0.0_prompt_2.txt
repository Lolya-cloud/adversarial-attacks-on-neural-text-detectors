Accessibility is a critical issue that affects people with physical disabilities across society. Despite the significant progress in the fight for equality over the years, individuals with disabilities still face significant challenges in accessing public spaces and services. Therefore, it's vital for the government to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. The truth is that there are still many barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society. The government must do more to create a level playing field for all citizens, including those with disabilities.

The basic needs of people with disabilities must be met, and access to public spaces is one of the fundamental needs. Adequate access to public spaces ensures that everyone can enjoy their rights as citizens without discrimination. It is the government's duty to make public spaces accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical ability. Public transport systems, schools, hospitals, and other public spaces must be wheelchair accessible, have ramps, tactile strips, and adequate lighting to enable people with disabilities to navigate comfortably.

The government must also ensure that public buildings and services are equipped with other accommodations that accommodate various disabilities, such as hearing and visual impairments. The government must invest in assistive technologies such as braille signs, audio descriptions, and other technologies that assist people with various disabilities to access public services. Without these accommodations, many people with disabilities are unable to access public services, resulting in unequal treatment, which is unjust and unacceptable in a modern and developed society.

The government should take proactive steps to ensure that all public service providers and private businesses meet accessibility standards so that people with disabilities can access services the same way as everyone else. Unfortunately, the reality is that while accessibility is often planned and prioritized in public structures, it is often overlooked in private buildings such as shops, restaurants, and hotels. The government must establish a policy that mandates all businesses, both large and small, to meet accessibility standards to avoid discrimination against people with disabilities.

Moreover, the government must ensure that all new infrastructure meets accessibility standards and is designed with the disabled community in mind. It's disappointing when new buildings are supposed to enhance the accessibility of public spaces, but the opposite is true. It's not enough to make changes as they go along; they must work with people with disabilities to have an adequate infrastructure and accessibility designs from the get-go. The government must establish an expert panel with people with disabilities to ensure that building plans meet accessibility standards and prioritize the needs of people with disabilities in designing public spaces.

In conclusion, the government must do more to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. Adequate accessibility standards must be met in public spaces, transportation, and buildings, with businesses and services equipped with assistive technologies and accommodations. Without sufficient provisions for people with disabilities, they will not have the same opportunities and experiences as their non-disabled peers. Improving accessibility is a critical step in creating a fairer and more inclusive society for everyone, regardless of their physical abilities. The government must take proactive and innovative measures that will positively impact the lives of people with disabilities, including establishing policies, investing in appropriate infrastructure, and involving disabled people in designing accessible public spaces.
