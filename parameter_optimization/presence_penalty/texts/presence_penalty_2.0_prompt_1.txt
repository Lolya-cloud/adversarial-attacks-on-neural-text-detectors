The death sentence, also known as capital punishment, has been a contentious issue across the world for decades. Some people argue that it serves as a deterrent measure to curb heinous crimes while others believe it infringes on the fundamental right to life, established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While many countries have abandoned the use of capital punishment, some still hold steadfastly to it. The question remains, should the death sentence be implemented globally? This essay shall present an argument against the implementation of the death sentence worldwide.

One of the main reasons why the death sentence should not be implemented globally is the possibility of wrongful convictions. It is no secret that many innocent people have been sentenced to death over the years. Given that the legal system is not infallible, it makes sense to abolish the death sentence and eliminate such errors completely. In addition, considering the cascade effect in law enforcement, when only one mistake can wrongfully induce several other convicts from far distance cases to suffer irrevocably related sentences, any possible error may tend to amplify its negative consequences.

Another critical reason against the implementation of the death sentence worldwide is financial. It costs more money to execute a prisoner than to keep them alive behind bars for the rest of their lives. The process of executing a person requires substantial resources, which could instead be used to improve prison infrastructure or invest in reformative programs for prisoners to reduce recidivism effectively. For instance, offenders can earn academic degrees and attain job training through educational and vocational programs to reintegrate into society after serving their sentences converges the suffering generated by incarceration back to acknowledgeable contributions to the socioeconomic growth of a country.

Moreover, the death sentence often results in human rights violations, particularly those relating to cruel and unusual punishment. Regardless of the offense committed, every individual retains certain basic human rights that cannot be taken away, including the right to be free from torture and persecution. Proponents may argue that execution by lethal injection is humane, but this contradicts reports indicating that the procedure has been known to cause prolonged suffering in some prisoners. Additionally, humanely administering capital punishment can still be considered an unethical and immoral act detrimental to a society's fundamental values.

Finally, proponents of the death sentence overlook its ineffectiveness as a deterrent measure. Statistics suggest that the presence or absence of capital punishment has no significant effect on crime rates. Countries with high homicide rates have reported using capital punishment, while others without it have seen lower levels of violent crimes. Instead, criminal justice systems should focus on preventative measures such as quality education, healthcare resources, job creation opportunities and creating equalities among all citizens from different status backgrounds, especially minorities, to inhibit the escalation of criminal manifestations in downtrodden populations.

In conclusion, the death sentence cannot effectively address the problems associated with increasing crime rate, nor does it eliminate the harm already inflicted upon victims and their families, but only marks the arbitrariness of social disparitiesâ€™ impact within a given jurisdiction. Based on factors mentioned above, abolitionists argue that worldwide capital punishment is neither ethical or economical solutions for any sovereign state choosing to embrace human rights progress. The balance between ensuring public safety and protecting human dignity must be perceptively assessed through effective holistic governmental policies rather than draconian approaches. Ultimately, every country and their relevant stakeholders must decide what kind of society they want to build and live in as one main factor to reject globally implemented capital punishment.
