The traditional high school curriculum has always consisted of a set content approved by the authorities. Students are expected to study the prescribed subjects, attend classes regularly and pass graded exams in them. This outdated system is not only stale but also fails to cater for the dynamic needs of individual students. It disregards the correlation that exists between tailored education and success.

Therefore, it is arguable that school students should be permitted to design their high school curriculum. By doing so, they would have more control over their intellectual destiny and would receive an education that meets their specific interests, passions and future aspirations. Allowing students to curate their own courses would emphasize creativity, problem-solving, leadership and teamwork skills- qualities which are crucial ingredients to succeed in life.

Additionally, with autonomy to take their academic choices, students would be given ownership of their educational pursuits. They would be empowered with decision-making skills besides acquiring new knowledge, thus guaranteeing self-confidence and good mental wellbeing. With teenage suicide rate at alarming levels, our education system needs to find more effective ways to address the emotional health of its students.

The current mainstream school curriculum has demonstrated glaring disparities between what's being taught in class and day-to-day life. Harmony among different cultures or a girlâ€™s menstruation cycle isn't something comprehensively covered in textbooks. Moreover, inflexible schedules leave no room for exploring alternative fields such as music, dance, art, drama, culinary arts, and extracurricular activates because students get limited time to involve themselves fully in them. These activities contribute significantly to character building, instills discipline, collaboration and communication skills. However, students should still be required to partake in general classes to ensure they acquire fundamental basics of science, maths, social studies which most universities require.

Critics might argue that allowing young teens to make significant decisions regarding their education poses far too much risk and could result in limiting potential opportunities down the road. Nevertheless, proponents of this idea strongly suggest that parent/guardian counseling and guidance counselors are required to overcome this potential shortfall. Additionally, students will have the responsibility of getting professional advice from their school advisors or university career offices on broadening prospects in future employment.

In conclusion, permitting high school students to design their tailor-made curriculum would provide a personalized approach as well as instilling invaluable skills like time-management, self-study and independence. Education experts, psychologists, and lawmakers should take bold steps to review how best we can remedy some of the significant flaws in our traditional education system by including our youth who represent the highest fraction of public education. It's now more than ever urgent to revise and empower them with opportunities to curate their own curriculum give them meaning and purpose while charting a route to success.
