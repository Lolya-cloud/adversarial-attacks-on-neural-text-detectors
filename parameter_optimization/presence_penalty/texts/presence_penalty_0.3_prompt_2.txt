Physical disabilities affect millions of people worldwide, and consequently, affect their ability to access various aspects of life. Despite significant progress in improving accessibility for people with disabilities, many still face considerable barriers. In this essay, I will argue that the government must do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities.

Firstly, improving accessibility is a fundamental human right. Every individual has the right to access basic amenities and opportunities regardless of their physical abilities. Therefore, governments have a responsibility to ensure that people with disabilities can access essential services such as education, healthcare, and government buildings. Many people with physical disabilities have been denied access to public transportation facilities, which hinders their mobility and independence. The government has a responsibility to address these challenges by providing accessible facilities or subsidizing private providers to guarantee these services reach people with disabilities.

Secondly, enhancing accessibility for people with physical disabilities opens up opportunities for everyone. Every individual can face physical disabilities regardless of their age. A lack of accessibility affects not only people with physical disabilities but also families, healthcare providers, friends, and colleagues of individuals with disabilities. Additionally, addressing the issue of accessibility by providing access ramps, wide doors, and automatic doors can help many other people, including the elderly, pregnant women, and parents with strollers.

Thirdly, improving accessibility for people with disabilities enhances economic activity. Disabled people are often excluded from the workforce due to their disabilities, despite having the necessary qualifications and skills for the job. Improving accessibility can help bridge this gap, enabling people with disabilities to access job opportunities, which contributes to economic growth. Furthermore, improving accessibility can contribute to boosting entrepreneurship among people with disabilities, who can create opportunities for themselves and others by developing innovative solutions to existing accessibility barriers.

Lastly, a more accessible environment fosters greater social inclusion for people with disabilities. Improved accessibility provides opportunities for disabled people to engage in activities with other members of society. For example, people with disabilities can enjoy visiting museums, attending concerts, and public events, increasing their social experiences and quality of life.

In conclusion, improving accessibility for people with physical disabilities is an essential step towards achieving inclusion and equality in society. The government must do more to ensure that individuals with disabilities can access essential services, education, employment, and other opportunities. The benefits of enhancing accessibility are enormous, and its impact is not limited to people with disabilities but society as a whole. Therefore, the government has a responsibility to take decisive action to achieve full accessibility for people with disabilities.
