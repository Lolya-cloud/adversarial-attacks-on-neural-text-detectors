As a society, we must strive to create a world that is inclusive of all individuals. This includes those with physical disabilities. However, despite the progress we have made in recent times, accessibility remains a significant issue for people with physical disabilities. The government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities because it is a fundamental human right, accessibility benefits not only the disabled but also society as a whole, and it is the government's responsibility to provide equal opportunities for all citizens.

Firstly, it is crucial to understand that accessibility is a fundamental human right. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) clearly states the obligation of governments to take appropriate measures to ensure that people with disabilities can access all places, services, and information without discrimination. Besides, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights also emphasizes the value of equal rights, non-discrimination, and inclusion. Therefore, the government must prioritize improving accessibility for persons with physical disabilities to fulfill their fundamental human right to equal opportunities.

Secondly, improving accessibility benefits not only the disabled but the whole society as well. For instance, when infrastructure like public transport is accessible, people with disabilities can travel freely and participate in economic activities. This contributes to economic growth as it creates more opportunities for disabled persons to contribute actively to the economy. Additionally, accessibility also promotes social inclusion by creating a society where everyone feels valued and respected. With better accessibility, persons with disabilities can enjoy the same experiences and opportunities as people without disabilities. Ultimately, creating an accessible world will drive innovation, creativity, and inclusiveness.

Finally, it is the government's primary responsibility to provide equal opportunities for all citizens. This includes ensuring that infrastructure, services, and information are accessible to people with physical disabilities. As such, the government has a significant role in promoting the welfare and equal treatment of everyone, including people with disabilities. Governments have the resources and power to make changes and provide accessible infrastructure, and it is their responsibility to do so. Besides, the cost of making changes to improve accessibility should not be a hindrance as it helps reduce costs associated with rehabilitation, healthcare, and social welfare.

In conclusion, it is crucial for the government to do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities. As a matter of fundamental human rights, the government must ensure that all citizens have equal opportunities regardless of their disabilities. Improved accessibility benefits not only the disabled but the whole society as well. Accessibility promotes inclusivity and drives innovation and creativity. Ultimately, it is the government's responsibility to provide a world that is inclusive of all individuals, and this includes improving accessibility for those with physical disabilities. By doing so, we create a society that thrives, free of discrimination and exclusion.
