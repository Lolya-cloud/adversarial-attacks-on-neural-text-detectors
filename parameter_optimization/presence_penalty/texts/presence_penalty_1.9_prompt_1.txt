The death sentence, or capital punishment, is one of the most controversial methods of criminal punishment around the world. While some countries have abolished it outright, others still use it as a means to deter crime and protect society from dangerous criminals. However, this has led to an ongoing debate with both supporters and opponents presenting valid arguments regarding its efficacy and morality.

One argument in support of implementing the death penalty globally is that it acts as a significant deterrent against heinous crimes. Some people believe that individuals who know they might face the maximum punishment are less likely to commit murder or other violent crimes than those who know that their jail time will eventually come to an end. Moreover, these individuals argue that when potential criminals realize that their fate will be death if they undertake particular crimes, they would most likely refrain from implementing them altogether.

Furthermore, another argument for imposing the death sentence is that it provides closure for victimsâ€™ families and loved ones. For example, suppose someone tragically loses a family member due to malicious intent by an offender or murderer. In that case, it brings justice and reprieve to have the culprit condemned and punished according to their actions. This can also discourage others from committing similar offenses, ultimately leading to a safer community for all.

On the other hand, those who oppose the universal adoption of capital punishment contend that there is no empirical evidence that the death penalty effectively reduces severe crimes such as murder or terrorism. In fact, recent studies suggest that countries without the death sentence have lower crime rates compared to those with it. Additionally, several factors such as poverty, unemployment, and poor education cause crime. Therefore, proponents of this argument assert that addressing these root causes- rather than just 'punishing' offenders - is crucial in reducing criminal activity.

In addition, critics argue that executing someone is immoral, stating that taking another life via the state perpetuates violence and does not align with fundamental human rights concepts. They contend that the legal system has a responsibility to protect all prisoners, including "death row inmates," and that there is always the possibility of wrong convictions or human errors. These issues are widely prevalent globally, raising serious concerns about implementing capital punishment.

In conclusion, while both sides pose valid arguments on whether to adopt the death sentence universally, it is crucial to note the importance of dignity in human life, accountability for one's actions, and most importantly, identifying and addressing root causes of crime. Ultimately, global implementation of the death penalty needs to be weighed heavily against its impact on human rights and justice. Therefore, policymakers must consider all factors before setting up measures such as capital punishment to fight criminal activity.
