The issue of the death sentence has been a controversial topic for decades. While some people believe that it is a necessary form of punishment, others argue that it is inhumane and flawed. However, there is an ongoing debate whether the implementation of the death penalty should be globalized. In this essay, I present my argument against its worldwide implementation.

Firstly, there are several ethical concerns surrounding the death penalty. The idea of state-sanctioned killing is inherently at odds with the values of human dignity as executions violate an individual's right to life. Advocates often argue that only persons who have committed acts of terror or heinous crimes deserve capital punishment. But what about the risk of executing innocent people or those convicted wrongly due to human error or prejudice? This is a prevalent issue that cannot be ignored. Moreover, we cannot ignore the impact that the death penalty has on the families and friends of the condemned, who frequently argue that they too are being punished for a crime they did not commit themselves.

Secondly, the legal system often enables significant bias towards marginalized groups. Poor and racial minorities, amongst others, may receive harsher sentences compared to their wealthier or Caucasian counterparts due to systemic issues involving classism and racism. Therefore, the widespread use of capital punishment places further marginalization and inequality on top of existing disparities within society. If we are seeking to create a fairer, more just world, we must reject all forms of barbaric punishment, including the death penalty.

Thirdly, acting in such a manner goes against what we should be striving to do if the aim is to shift towards a rehabilitative approach to criminal justice. The purpose of incarceration must be to reform individuals into productive members of society rather than enact vengeance. By no means does this equate to eliminating punishment, but instead, adopting a restorative process that does not involve institutionalizing violence. Research typically indicates that education and counseling rehabilitation programs have more impactful positive outcomes for re-entry back into society.

Finally, the global implementation of capital punishment creates barriers to international collaboration and peacekeeping efforts. The effectiveness of these programs relies on reliance amongst world powers and organization working together towards a common goal. Besides, governments that use capital punishment alienate themselves from other nations, reducing diplomatic potential and threatening international agreements and cooperation.

In conclusion, the death penalty is an immoral and inhumane interpretation of justice that has no place in modern, progressive society. Its global now can be argued stating that it serves as a deterrent or brings closure to victims' families. But we must remember that one injustice cannot replace another, regardless of the circumstances. Instead, we must strive for a more comprehensive review of our criminal justice system globally, aiming to discover alternatives to bad habits finally leaning into constructing equitable societies.
