Education is a fundamental aspect of human life, and it is a critical component of preparing students for their future. The high school curriculum is the foundation of a student's academic journey, and it is crucial that it is designed to meet their unique needs. One way to achieve this is by allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. This essay argues that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum because it fosters student engagement, promotes personal growth, and allows for a more personalized learning experience.

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum fosters student engagement. When students are given the freedom to choose the subjects they study, they become more invested in their education. They are more likely to be interested in what they are learning and are more likely to actively participate in class. This engagement can lead to better academic performance and increased motivation to learn. Additionally, allowing students to curate their curriculum empowers them to take ownership of their education, which can lead to a sense of pride and accomplishment.

Another benefit of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it promotes personal growth. High school is a time of self-discovery, and students need the opportunity to explore their interests and passions. When students have the freedom to choose the subjects they study, they can explore areas of interest that they may not have had the opportunity to explore otherwise. This exploration can lead to personal growth, as students discover new talents and interests. Additionally, allowing students to curate their curriculum can help them develop critical thinking skills, as they must consider their interests and academic goals when selecting their courses.

Finally, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum allows for a more personalized learning experience. Every student is unique, and their educational needs vary. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, schools can tailor their education to meet their individual needs. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in science, they can focus on science courses and electives that will prepare them for their future. This personalized learning experience can lead to greater academic success and a better-prepared workforce.

Opponents of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that it may lead to a lack of standardization and may result in students not being adequately prepared for college or the workforce. However, this argument is flawed. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, schools can still ensure that students are meeting academic standards and are adequately prepared for their future. Additionally, students who curate their curriculum are more likely to be engaged in their education and are more likely to be motivated to learn.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is beneficial for both students and schools. It fosters student engagement, promotes personal growth, and allows for a more personalized learning experience. While there may be concerns about standardization, these concerns can be addressed by ensuring that students are still meeting academic standards. By allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, schools can better prepare students for their future and help them achieve their academic and personal goals.
