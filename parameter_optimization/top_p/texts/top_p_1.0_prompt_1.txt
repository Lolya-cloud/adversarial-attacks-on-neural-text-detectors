As an AI language model, I do not have the personal setting to have a belief or opinion, but I could present an essay based on common views from resources and the general societies.

The death sentence, also known as capital punishment, has been a controversial topic for centuries. It involves the state legally executing an individual for a crime they have committed. While some argue that it is a necessary form of punishment, others believe that it is inhumane and should be abolished. In this essay, we will explore the arguments for and against implementing the death sentence globally.

Those who support the death sentence argue that it acts as a deterrent for potential criminals. The idea is that if individuals know they risk being put to death for their actions, they will be less likely to commit crimes. Additionally, supporters argue that the death sentence serves as a form of justice for the victims and their families, providing them with closure and a sense of satisfaction that the perpetrator has received the ultimate punishment.

Opponents of the death sentence argue that it is a violation of human rights and that it does not serve as a deterrent for potential criminals. Studies have shown that there is no conclusive evidence that implementing the death sentence reduces crime rates. Additionally, opponents argue that the death sentence is often implemented unfairly, with marginalized individuals and people of color being disproportionately sentenced to death. They also argue that innocent people have been wrongfully sentenced to death, and once executed, there is no way to reverse the decision.

Implementing the death sentence globally is a complicated issue. On one hand, it could act as a deterrent for potential criminals, and it could provide justice for victims and their families. On the other hand, it is a violation of human rights, it does not necessarily reduce crime rates, and it can be implemented unfairly.

Moreover, if the death sentence is implemented globally, it could tarnish the image and reputation of a country or state that practices it. Global leaders might designate specific countries as substandard, cruel, or barbaric for continuing the death sentence. As a result, the affected countries could lose the trust of their allies, status, and influence in international matters.

In conclusion, the implementation of the death sentence globally is a complicated and controversial topic. While some argue that it is a necessary form of punishment for heinous crimes, others believe that it is inhumane and unjust. Ultimately, it is up to individual countries and states to decide whether or not to implement it based on their own legal, moral, and ethical frameworks. Nonetheless, collaborative and diplomatic dialogues among countries could be more beneficial to help establish fair and just criminal justice systems globally.
