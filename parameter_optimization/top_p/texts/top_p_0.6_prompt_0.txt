The education system has always been a topic of debate, with various stakeholders having different opinions on how it should be run. One of the most controversial issues is whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. While some argue that it would be beneficial for students to have more control over their education, others believe that it would be detrimental to the quality of education. In this essay, I will argue that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would give them more control over their education. Currently, students have limited say in what they learn in school. They are required to take certain courses and follow a set curriculum, regardless of their interests or career aspirations. Allowing students to choose their courses would give them the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests. This would not only make learning more enjoyable but also motivate them to excel in their studies.

Secondly, curating their high school curriculum would enable students to tailor their education to their future career goals. Every student has unique aspirations, and the current education system does not cater to these individual needs. By allowing students to choose their courses, they would be able to focus on subjects that are relevant to their future careers. This would not only prepare them better for the workforce but also help them make informed decisions about their future.

Thirdly, curating their high school curriculum would foster independence and responsibility in students. The current education system is structured in a way that does not encourage students to take responsibility for their learning. By allowing them to choose their courses, students would be forced to take ownership of their education. This would teach them valuable life skills such as time management, decision making, and critical thinking. These skills are essential for success in any field, and the education system should strive to instill them in students.

Lastly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would promote creativity and innovation. The current education system is focused on rote learning and memorization. This does not encourage students to think outside the box or come up with creative solutions to problems. By allowing students to choose their courses, they would be exposed to a wider range of subjects and ideas. This would enable them to think more creatively and innovatively, which is essential for success in today's rapidly changing world.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum would be beneficial for their education and future career prospects. It would give them more control over their education, enable them to tailor their education to their career goals, foster independence and responsibility, and promote creativity and innovation. The education system should strive to empower students and provide them with the tools they need to succeed in the 21st century. Allowing them to curate their high school curriculum is a step in the right direction.
