Education is a fundamental right of every individual, and it is essential for the development of a society. The traditional education system has been in place for centuries, and it has been successful in imparting knowledge to students. However, with the changing times, there is a need to re-evaluate the education system and make it more relevant to the needs of the students. One way to achieve this is by allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum.

The current education system is rigid and does not allow students to choose the subjects they want to study. The curriculum is designed by the education board, and students have to follow it without any say in the matter. This approach is flawed because it assumes that all students have the same interests and abilities. However, this is not the case, and students have different strengths and weaknesses. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to choose the subjects they are interested in and excel in them.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would make education more relevant to their future careers. The current education system is based on a one-size-fits-all approach, which does not take into account the individual needs of students. By allowing students to choose the subjects they want to study, they can tailor their education to their future career goals. For example, a student who wants to pursue a career in medicine can choose to study biology, chemistry, and physics, while a student who wants to pursue a career in journalism can choose to study English, media studies, and communication.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would increase their motivation to learn. When students are given the freedom to choose the subjects they want to study, they are more likely to be engaged in the learning process. This is because they are studying subjects that interest them, and they are more likely to put in the effort to excel in them. This approach would also reduce the dropout rate because students would be studying subjects that they are passionate about.

However, some argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would lead to a lack of standardization in education. They argue that the education board has a better understanding of the subjects that students need to study to be successful in life. However, this argument is flawed because it assumes that all students have the same needs. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to choose the subjects that are relevant to their needs and interests.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum would be beneficial for their education and future careers. It would enable them to choose the subjects they are interested in, make education more relevant to their future careers, and increase their motivation to learn. The education system needs to be re-evaluated to make it more relevant to the needs of the students. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is a step in the right direction.
