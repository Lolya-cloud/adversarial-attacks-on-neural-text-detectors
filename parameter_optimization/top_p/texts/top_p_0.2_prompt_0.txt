Education is a fundamental right of every individual, and it is essential for the development of a society. The traditional education system has been in place for centuries, and it has been successful in imparting knowledge to students. However, with the changing times, there is a need to re-evaluate the education system and make it more relevant to the needs of the students. One way to achieve this is by allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum.

The current education system is rigid and does not allow students to choose the subjects they want to study. The curriculum is designed by the education board, and students have to follow it without any say in the matter. This approach is flawed because it assumes that all students have the same interests and abilities. However, this is not the case, and students have different strengths and weaknesses. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to choose the subjects they are interested in and excel in them.

Moreover, students who are interested in a particular subject are more likely to be motivated to learn and perform well. When students are forced to study subjects they are not interested in, they are likely to lose interest in education altogether. This can lead to poor academic performance and a lack of motivation to pursue higher education. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would ensure that they are motivated to learn and perform well.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to pursue their passions and interests. Many students have talents and interests outside of the traditional subjects taught in schools. For example, a student who is interested in music may want to take music classes instead of physics. Allowing students to choose their subjects would enable them to pursue their passions and interests, which would lead to a more fulfilling education experience.

However, some argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would lead to a lack of standardization in education. They argue that the education board designs the curriculum to ensure that all students receive the same education and are prepared for higher education. However, this argument is flawed because it assumes that all students have the same interests and abilities. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would ensure that they receive an education that is tailored to their interests and abilities.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum would be beneficial for their education and personal development. It would enable them to choose the subjects they are interested in, pursue their passions and interests, and be motivated to learn and perform well. The education system needs to be re-evaluated to ensure that it is relevant to the needs of the students. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is a step in the right direction.
