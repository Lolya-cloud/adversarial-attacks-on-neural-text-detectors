In recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum. While some argue that this would give students a sense of control and ownership over their education, others feel that it would lead to an uneven distribution of knowledge and skills among students. In this essay, I will argue that students should not be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum.

One of the main reasons why students should not be allowed to curate their own curriculum is that it would lead to an uneven distribution of knowledge and skills. While some students may have a strong interest in certain subjects, others may not be as interested in them. As a result, if students were allowed to choose their own curriculum, it is likely that some students would have gaps in their knowledge or skills when compared to their peers. This could put them at a disadvantage when applying for college or entering the workforce.

Additionally, allowing students to curate their own curriculum could be seen as a form of educational privilege. Students who come from wealthier or more educated families are more likely to have a broad range of knowledge and expertise, which would make it easier for them to curate a well-rounded curriculum. Conversely, students who come from less privileged backgrounds may not have access to the same educational resources, and may therefore struggle to make informed decisions about their education. This could perpetuate existing inequalities in education and limit opportunities for social mobility.

Another argument against students curating their own curriculum is that it would be difficult for schools to maintain educational standards. In order to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education, schools have to meet certain standards and benchmarks. Allowing students to curate their own curriculum could make it difficult for schools to ensure that all students are meeting these standards. This could result in a decline in overall academic performance and may make it more difficult for schools to attract and retain high-quality teachers.

However, proponents of curating their own curriculum believe it would provide students with a sense of control, ownership, and autonomy over their education. They may argue that students who are allowed to choose their own curriculum would be more engaged in their studies and therefore perform better academically. Moreover, they argue that students who are given the opportunity to study subjects they are passionate about will be more likely to pursue careers in those fields, leading to greater career satisfaction and success.

In conclusion, while there may be some advantages to allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum, there are also many potential drawbacks. Allowing students to curate their own curriculum could result in an uneven distribution of knowledge and skills among students, creating educational privilege and making it difficult for schools to maintain educational standards. Therefore, it is important for schools to maintain control over their curriculum to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education and have access to the same opportunities for success.
