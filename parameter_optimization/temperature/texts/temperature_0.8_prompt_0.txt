The education system has evolved over time, yet the approach to curriculum development has remained static. Currently, students have little or no say in the development of their high school curriculum. This approach is highly flawed and needs to be changed. In this regard, it is imperative to consider whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. 

Firstly, students' input in their education can lead to better learning outcomes. Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in the subjects they are studying. When students are allowed to curate their curriculum, they can choose subjects that they are passionate about. Passion has been proven to enhance learning outcomes, as students are more likely to engage and participate in learning activities. Additionally, students can choose subjects that align with their career goals and interests. This prepares them for their future careers and helps them achieve their desired goals. 

Secondly, allowing students to curate their curriculum can promote independent thinking and decision-making skills. These are essential skills that are necessary for success in the real world. When students are allowed to choose their subjects, they have to evaluate their interests, strengths, and weaknesses, and make informed choices. This practice can help them develop critical thinking and decision-making skills, which are valuable in both their personal and professional lives. 

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their curriculum can promote inclusivity and diversity. Currently, most high schools have a standard curriculum that is not tailored to meet the diverse needs of students. Allowing students to curate their curriculum can provide an opportunity for students to study subjects that are not currently offered in their schools. This can promote diversity in the curriculum and provide opportunities for students to learn about different cultures, perspectives, and experiences. Additionally, allowing students to curate their curriculum can offer opportunities to learn courses aligned with modern technology, which is also essential for career growth. 

In contrast, opponents of students curating their curriculum argue that students may choose subjects that are easy to score or may not choose essential subjects. This argument is flawed because students are more likely to choose subjects that are essential for their career growth. Additionally, students can be guided by their teachers and counselors on the subjects that are essential for their academic and career growth. 

Moreover, critics argue that allowing students to curate their curriculum may not guarantee that they will be able to cope with the complexity of the subjects chosen. This argument is also flawed because students can take responsibility for the outcome of their choices. They can choose subjects that align with their interests and academic ability. Additionally, students can be provided with the necessary resources and support to help them cope with the complexity of the subjects they have chosen. 

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum can lead to better learning outcomes, promote independent thinking, and decision-making skills, promote inclusivity and diversity, and better prepare students for their future careers. The current approach to curriculum development is flawed and needs to be changed. It is time for schools to consider allowing students to curate their high school curriculum.
