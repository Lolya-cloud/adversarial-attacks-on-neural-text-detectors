Education is a fundamental right for every individual, and it is the responsibility of the educational institutions to provide students with the best possible education. However, the traditional education system has been criticized for its rigidity and lack of flexibility. Students are often forced to study subjects that are not relevant to their interests or career aspirations. This has led to a growing demand for a more personalized education system that allows students to curate their high school curriculum. In this essay, I will argue that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to pursue their interests and passions. Every student has unique interests and talents, and the traditional education system fails to cater to these individual needs. By allowing students to choose their subjects, they can focus on areas that they are passionate about, which can lead to better academic performance and increased motivation. For example, a student who is interested in music can choose to study music theory and composition, while a student who is interested in science can choose to study advanced physics and chemistry.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can prepare them for their future careers. The traditional education system often focuses on theoretical knowledge, which may not be relevant to real-world situations. By allowing students to choose their subjects, they can gain practical skills and knowledge that are relevant to their future careers. For example, a student who wants to become a software developer can choose to study computer programming and software engineering, while a student who wants to become a doctor can choose to study biology and anatomy.

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can promote creativity and innovation. The traditional education system often restricts creativity and innovation by imposing rigid rules and regulations. By allowing students to choose their subjects, they can explore new ideas and concepts, which can lead to innovative solutions to real-world problems. For example, a student who is interested in environmental issues can choose to study environmental science and develop innovative solutions to reduce carbon emissions.

However, some may argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may lead to a lack of diversity in education. They may argue that students may choose to study only subjects that they are interested in, which may lead to a lack of exposure to other subjects. However, this argument is flawed because students can still be required to study a certain number of core subjects, such as English, math, and science, to ensure a well-rounded education.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can have numerous benefits, including enabling them to pursue their interests and passions, preparing them for their future careers, and promoting creativity and innovation. The traditional education system has been criticized for its rigidity and lack of flexibility, and it is time for a more personalized education system that caters to the individual needs of students. Therefore, I strongly believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.
