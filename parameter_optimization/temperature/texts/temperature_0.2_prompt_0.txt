The education system has been designed to provide students with a standardized curriculum that is meant to prepare them for the future. However, this approach has been criticized for not taking into account the individual needs and interests of students. As a result, there has been a growing demand for students to be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. In this essay, I will argue that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to pursue their interests and passions. Currently, the curriculum is designed to provide a broad-based education that covers a range of subjects. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that students have different interests and passions. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, they would be able to focus on the subjects that they are passionate about. This would not only make learning more enjoyable but would also enable students to develop their skills and talents in areas that they are interested in.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to take ownership of their education. Currently, students are passive recipients of education, with little say in what they learn. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, they would be able to take ownership of their education and become active participants in the learning process. This would not only make learning more engaging but would also enable students to develop critical thinking and decision-making skills.

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to prepare for their future careers. Currently, the curriculum is designed to provide a broad-based education that covers a range of subjects. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that students have different career aspirations. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, they would be able to focus on the subjects that are relevant to their future careers. This would not only make learning more relevant but would also enable students to develop the skills and knowledge that they need to succeed in their chosen careers.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to pursue their interests and passions, take ownership of their education, and prepare for their future careers. While there may be concerns about the quality and consistency of education, these can be addressed through appropriate oversight and guidance. Ultimately, the benefits of allowing students to curate their curriculum far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Therefore, I believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.
