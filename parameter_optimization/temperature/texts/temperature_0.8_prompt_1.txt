The death sentence has been a controversial issue globally for decades. Some countries have abolished it, while others continue to implement it. The question that arises is whether the death sentence should be implemented globally. In my opinion, the death sentence should not be implemented globally due to several reasons.

Firstly, the death sentence violates human rights. Every human being has the right to life, and the death sentence takes away that right. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights endorses this right, and 106 countries have abolished the death penalty as a result. In countries where the death sentence is still implemented, there have been cases of wrongful convictions and executions, which only serve to highlight the flawed nature of the practice.

Secondly, the death sentence is irreversible. Once a person is executed, there is no chance of reversing the decision. This is why most countries have abolished the death sentence, as there have been cases of wrongful convictions. People have been released from prison after spending decades behind bars for crimes they did not commit. The death penalty denies people the chance to rectify their mistakes or prove their innocence, and this is against the principles of justice.

Thirdly, the death sentence is not a deterrent to crime. Some people argue that the death sentence is an effective deterrent to crime, but this is not always the case. Most of the countries with the highest murder rates are those that have the death penalty. This is because the decision to commit a crime is often influenced by various factors, such as social and economic conditions, and the death sentence does not address these factors. Instead, it only serves to perpetuate the cycle of violence and revenge.

Fourthly, the death sentence is expensive. The cost of implementing the death sentence is higher than that of life imprisonment. This is because of the lengthy legal process involved, including the appeals process. The money spent on the death penalty could be used to fund other areas such as education and healthcare.

In conclusion, the death sentence should not be implemented globally. It violates human rights, is irreversible, ineffective as a deterrent to crime, and is expensive. There is a need to explore alternative forms of punishment that are just and humane. Restorative justice, for example, focuses on repairing the harm caused by a crime rather than punishing the offender. This approach has been successful in some countries and should be explored further. The death sentence is a relic of a bygone era and has no place in a modern society that values justice, human rights, and fairness.
