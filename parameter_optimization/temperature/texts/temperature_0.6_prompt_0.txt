In modern times, the education system has been subject to much criticism. Critics have always argued that the curriculum is outdated and does not cater to the individual needs of students. It is essential to note that students have different interests and aspirations, and therefore, the education system should be flexible enough to accommodate their preferences. In light of this, the question arises, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? I believe that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum, and this essay will explore the reasons why.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will foster creativity and innovation. Students have different interests and aspirations, and therefore, they should be given the freedom to choose the subjects that align with their interests. This will give them the opportunity to explore their passions and talents, leading to the development of new ideas and innovations. For instance, if a student is interested in music and has a passion for playing the guitar, they should be allowed to choose music as one of their subjects. This will enable them to develop their musical skills and even create new music.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will enhance their academic performance. When students are allowed to choose the subjects they are interested in, they are more likely to engage in their studies and perform better. This is because they have a personal interest in the subject matter, and therefore, they are more motivated to learn. In addition, students will be able to choose the subjects that align with their career aspirations, leading to better academic performance and career prospects.

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will promote inclusivity and diversity. The current education system is rigid and does not cater to the needs of students from diverse backgrounds. Allowing students to choose their subjects will enable them to explore their cultural and ethnic heritage, leading to a more inclusive and diverse education system. For instance, if a student is interested in learning about their African heritage, they should be allowed to choose subjects that explore African history and culture.

However, opponents of this idea argue that students may not have the necessary knowledge and expertise to curate their high school curriculum. They argue that students may choose subjects that are not necessary for their academic and career development. While this may be true to some extent, it is essential to note that students will receive guidance from their teachers and parents when choosing their subjects. Moreover, students will be required to meet certain academic standards to graduate, ensuring that they have a well-rounded education.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is a step in the right direction towards a more inclusive and diverse education system. It will foster creativity and innovation, enhance academic performance, and promote inclusivity and diversity. While opponents of this idea may argue that students may not have the necessary knowledge and expertise to curate their high school curriculum, it is essential to note that students will receive guidance from their teachers and parents. Therefore, the education system should be flexible enough to accommodate the individual needs and interests of students.
