Education is a fundamental right for every individual, and it is essential to have a curriculum that caters to the needs and interests of students. The traditional curriculum in high schools is often rigid, and students do not have much say in what they learn. However, the question arises whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. In this essay, I will argue that students should be given the freedom to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will increase their engagement and motivation towards learning. When students have a say in what they learn, they are more likely to be interested and invested in the subject matter. According to a study conducted by the National Education Association, student engagement increases when students have a voice in their learning. Students who are engaged in their learning are more likely to succeed academically and have a positive attitude towards education.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will enable them to pursue their interests and passions. Every student has different interests and strengths, and a one-size-fits-all curriculum does not cater to their individual needs. Students who are interested in a particular subject should have the opportunity to explore it in-depth and develop their skills and knowledge. Allowing students to choose their courses will also help them prepare for their future careers and pursue their dreams.

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will help them develop critical thinking and decision-making skills. When students have to make decisions about their courses, they have to consider their interests, strengths, and career goals. This process will help them develop essential skills such as decision-making, problem-solving, and critical thinking. These skills are essential for success in college and the workplace.

However, some may argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to a lack of knowledge and skills in essential subjects. While it is essential to have a foundation in core subjects such as math, science, and English, students should also have the freedom to choose courses that interest them. Moreover, students should be guided by their teachers and counselors to ensure that they have a well-rounded education.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is essential for their academic success, personal growth, and career preparation. Students who have a voice in their learning are more engaged, motivated, and interested in their education. Allowing students to choose their courses will also help them pursue their interests, develop critical thinking skills, and prepare for their future careers. Therefore, high schools should provide students with the freedom to curate their curriculum while ensuring that they have a well-rounded education.
