Accessibility is a term that refers to the ease of access to facilities, buildings, and other infrastructure for all individuals, regardless of their physical abilities. It is crucial to ensure that people with physical disabilities have equal access to public spaces and services. Unfortunately, many individuals with disabilities face significant challenges in accessing the same opportunities as the able-bodied population. This essay argues that the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities.

Firstly, promoting accessibility for people with physical disabilities is a human rights issue. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) affirmed that "Persons with disabilities have the right to access, on an equal basis with others, the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems." The government has an obligation to ensure that people with disabilities can access services and facilities without any discrimination. Failure to provide access to public spaces and services is a violation of basic human rights.

Secondly, promoting accessibility benefits not only people with disabilities but society as a whole. Accessible environments promote inclusivity and diversity. They enable people with disabilities to participate in the labor force, education, and civic activities. This, in turn, facilitates higher contributions to the economy and society at large. Accessible infrastructure also benefits the elderly and parents with young children, who may require additional support. Improved accessibility for people with disabilities can, therefore, create a ripple effect that benefits everyone.

Thirdly, the government has a role to play in removing barriers to accessibility. Some organizations may argue that accessibility should be left to the private sector. However, there are cases where the private sector alone may not address accessibility issues. For example, businesses may be required to make modifications to their facilities, which may be expensive and not feasible for small businesses. The government can provide incentives, tax rebates, or grants to make it feasible for businesses to make their premises more accessible. The government can also set standards and enforce them to ensure that all infrastructure, including public and private facilities, meets minimum accessibility requirements.

Finally, promoting accessibility is cost-effective in the long run. The cost of retrofitting public and private infrastructure may seem high initially. However, the cost of not having accessible infrastructure is also high. People with disabilities may require additional support, such as home care, if they cannot access public spaces and services. This can put a significant economic burden on the government and society at large. In contrast, investing in accessibility can help to prevent such costs and create long-term benefits that exceed the initial investment.

In conclusion, promoting accessibility for people with physical disabilities is a human rights issue that benefits society as a whole. The government has a role to play in removing barriers to accessibility, setting standards, and enforcing them. While the initial investment in accessibility may seem high, it is cost-effective in the long run. By promoting accessibility, we can create a more inclusive society that values diversity and benefits everyone.
