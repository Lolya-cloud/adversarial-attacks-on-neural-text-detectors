Education is a crucial aspect of a person's life, and it is essential to have access to quality education to lead a successful and fulfilling life. High school is a critical period in a student's life, where they learn, grow and prepare for their future. However, the current high school curriculum is rigid and does not always meet the needs and interests of students. This raises the question, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? In this essay, I will argue that high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their curriculum would be beneficial for their academic and personal growth. Every student is unique and has different interests, skills and strengths. Giving them the opportunity to choose what they study would help them explore their passions and develop skills that are relevant to their career goals. This would also make learning more engaging and enjoyable, leading to better academic performance and retention of information. Furthermore, empowering students to be active participants in their education would promote self-directed learning and autonomy, which are essential qualities for success in college and beyond.

Secondly, giving students the freedom to curate their curriculum would foster a sense of responsibility and accountability. When students are given a say in their education, they are more likely to take ownership of their learning and be motivated to succeed. They would have to make informed decisions about what courses to take, and this would encourage them to think critically and consider their goals and aspirations. This would also prepare them for the challenges of adulthood where they would have to make similar decisions about their careers and personal lives.

Thirdly, a student-driven curriculum would be more inclusive and diverse. The traditional high school curriculum is often euro-centric and does not always reflect the experiences and perspectives of all students. Allowing students to choose what they study would enable them to explore different cultures, histories, and social issues that are relevant to their lives. This would create a more inclusive and diverse educational experience that celebrates differences and promotes empathy and understanding.

However, some may argue that allowing students to curate their curriculum would lead to a fragmented and disjointed education system. They may also argue that students may not have the necessary knowledge and expertise to make informed decisions about what courses to take. While these concerns are valid, they can be addressed by providing students with guidance and support. School counsellors, teachers, and parents can work together to help students make informed choices about their education. Furthermore, by allowing students to curate their curriculum, they would have to take more responsibility for their learning, which would prepare them for the responsibilities of adult life.

In conclusion, high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. This would lead to a more engaging, inclusive, and diverse educational experience that prepares students for success in college and beyond. It would also foster a sense of responsibility and accountability and empower students to take ownership of their learning. While there may be challenges in implementing such a system, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Empowering students to be active participants in their education is critical to their academic and personal growth and their success in the future.
