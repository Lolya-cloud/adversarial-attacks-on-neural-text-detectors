Todayâ€™s world is evolving rapidly in terms of technological advancements, scientific researches, and innovations. We are experiencing massive advancements in various industries, and it has become essential to make the students equipped with skills and knowledge relevant to the current times. In order to achieve this objective, students should take control of their high school curriculum. Allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum could bridge the gap between education and the real world, inspire creativity, and provide students with the power to pursue subjects they are interested in.

Firstly, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum could significantly help to bridge the gap between education and the real world. In schools, students are taught based on a fixed, predetermined curriculum that doesn't evolve or change with time. By allowing students to curate their own curriculum, they would have the power to incorporate current affairs and trends into their academic program. This would provide them with much-needed context and a sense of relevance, which is essential in preparing them for the real world.

Secondly, curating their own high school curriculum could inspire creativity among students. When students choose the subjects they want to study, they would be more motivated to learn because they would find the subjects interesting. This way, the students would showcase their creativity when designing and executing their academic curriculum. This approach could create a more engaging and dynamic learning process rather than relying on a standard predetermined curriculum.

Lastly, allowing students to choose their curriculum could help them explore and pursue their interest. Many students find the idea of education boring due to the lack of choice they have regarding the subjects. By allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, they would have the power to pursue the subjects they are interested in and achieve academic excellence in subjects they love. This approach would create an environment that fosters student growth and development, which encourages creativity, curiosity, and innovation.

Despite the merits of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, some disadvantages would arise if this approach was implemented. For example, some students might not have adequate knowledge to choose the subjects which are essential for their future career prospects. This could lead to a situation where students choose subjects that do not align with their career path or future goals.

To address these concerns, schools could provide guidance on career prospects, educational requirements, and what subjects students need to succeed in their desired field. Teachers and guidance counselors would help the students in selecting the appropriate path that would lead them to achieve their desired academic and professional goals.

In conclusion, there is a need for a paradigm shift in the educational system, where students curate their high school curriculum. This approach would allow students to integrate current events and trends into their learning process, inspire creativity and provide students with the power to pursue the subjects that interest them. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is a significant step in the right direction in creating an education system that fosters student growth, development and is responsive to the changing needs of the world.
