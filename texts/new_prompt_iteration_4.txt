As a student, I have always felt like I lacked control over my education. We were expected to learn whatever was on the syllabus, follow the teacher’s instructions, and complete the homework assigned to us. But what about the topics that genuinely interested us? Why weren't we given the autonomy to choose what we wanted to study?

This has been a contentious topic for years, with people divided on whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. At its core, the issue is about students' agency and the educational system's ability to meet their needs. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument and give my opinion.

On the one hand, the proponents of student-led curriculums argue that students should be given more control over their learning experience. A student's natural curiosity can be harnessed to create a more engaging and productive learning environment. Allowing students to choose their subjects can help them feel more motivated and invested, leading to a better understanding of the topics covered. Moreover, it can encourage creativity and exploration, pushing students to pursue passions that could lead to long-term career options.

On the other hand, some people believe that this approach is risky. Students may lack the experience and knowledge to make the right choices about their curriculum. They might select subjects based on what they think might be easy or fun, rather than how vital it is to meet career goals. As a result, some educators feel that students should not be given this kind of freedom, especially given how competitive the workforce is.

Despite the two sides of the argument, I believe students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. I am of the opinion that when students are taught using a curriculum that resonates with them, they are better equipped to soak up more information. Additionally, having the autonomy to curate their curriculum could teach students one of life’s most essential skills - decision-making.

To bring my argument home, here are a few rhetorical questions to ponder over: Which student wouldn't be thrilled to be able to choose what they study? Why wouldn't a student prefer a curriculum that caters to their interests? Moreover, wouldn't this approach encourage learning, rather than pessimism?

In conclusion, the idea of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can be beneficial. It can serve as a means to provide students with a sense of ownership, responsibility, and encourage the development of lifelong learning skills. While it may be challenging to implement in some schools, the solution to creating a successful learning experience may well lie in giving students the power to curate some parts of their education.
