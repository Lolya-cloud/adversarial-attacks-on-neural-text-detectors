As students progress through their academic careers, it is not uncommon for them to feel like they are not being offered the courses that they would like to take. Whether it is because of a lack of resources, outdated curricula, or simply a lack of interest from administrators, many high school students can feel left out when it comes to their educational opportunities. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to allow students to curate their own high school curriculum, as a way to provide more personalized and engaging educational experiences. This essay will explore the arguments for and against allowing students to design their own high school curriculum, ultimately arriving at a conclusion as to whether or not this is a beneficial idea.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum is that it can help to foster a sense of ownership and investment in their education. When students feel like they have a say in what they are learning, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to do well. They are also more likely to see the relevance of what they are learning to their lives and future career aspirations if they are given the freedom to choose their own courses.

Another argument in favor of student-led curriculum design is that it can help to prepare students for the real world. In the workplace, employees are often expected to take ownership of their own professional development and seek out opportunities for learning and growth. By giving high school students the chance to do the same, we are preparing them for a world where self-direction and autonomy are highly valued.

On the other hand, there are also some valid concerns about allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum. One of the main concerns is that students may choose courses that are not rigorous or academically challenging enough. Without guidance from teachers and administrators, students might not fully understand the implications of their choices and may end up limiting themselves in terms of future academic and career opportunities.

Another concern is that allowing students to curate their own curriculum could exacerbate existing inequalities in the education system. Students from less advantaged backgrounds may not have the same access to information and resources needed to make informed decisions about course selection. Additionally, schools with limited resources may not be able to offer the full range of courses that students might want to take, further exacerbating existing disparities.

In conclusion, while there are certainly valid concerns about allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum, there are also compelling arguments in its favor. Ultimately, the decision to implement such a policy should be made based on a careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as a thorough assessment of the resources and support needed to make it work. If done well, however, student-led curriculum design could help to engage and motivate students, better prepare them for the real world, and create a more personalized and relevant high school experience for all students.
