In the contemporary era, education is not limited to memorization and learning specific concepts in the classroom. In modern times, students are required to develop a skill set that prepares them for the workplace and various other life situations. One way to promote these skills is to encourage students to curate their high school curriculum. In this essay, we shall explore the benefits and drawbacks of allowing students to design their academic curriculum and examine why it’s important to give students the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, permitting students to curate their high school curriculum can be an excellent way to foster independence and responsibility in learners. Students who get a chance to choose their courses tend to be more engaged in their academic work and take a more proactive approach to their education. It motivates them to take the initiative and become part of their own education, helping them become more confident and develop the skills and work habits needed to succeed later in life.

Moreover, allowing students to design their high school curriculum can improve their academic performance. When students have the opportunity to personalize their academic plans, they are more likely to pick subjects and courses that interest them. Such students tend to be more motivated when it comes to learning, resulting in improved academic performance.

In addition to fostering independence, responsibility and improved academic performance, student- curated education can also increase students’ motivation to learn. When learners have a say in their education, they are more likely to enjoy the learning process. If given a choice, students may prefer subjects that correspond to their interests, passions, and abilities, which have a direct impact on motivation to learn.

On the flip side, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may come with some disadvantages. One drawback could be that students may be unable to make the right decisions when it comes to course selection. For example, they may lack knowledge about which subjects will be the best fit for their intended career path. Additionally, the course choices available to students may not be adequate for learners who desire a unique academic experience or different skill set than one would get from a typical high school curriculum.

However, these potential drawbacks can be mitigated by pairing student-centered learning with interventions such as academic counseling, which would provide advice and feedback on course selection. Additionally, schools could create a broad range of course offerings so that students can shape their academic trajectory.

In conclusion, empowering students to curate their high school curricula is a positive move in modern education. Allowing students to take charge of their academic plans can foster independence, responsibility, improved academic performance, and increased motivation to learn. Though there may be some drawbacks, these challenges can be overcome with adequate assistance from academic counselors and offering diverse course schedules. Therefore, it’s essential for schools to find ways to give students some control and accountability over their academic future, and student-curated education is a perfect way to achieve this.
