Education is the backbone of a nation's development, and the curriculum is its heart. It defines what students learn, how they learn, and how they are assessed. Therefore, it is only fitting for the curriculum to align with the students' interests and goals to achieve maximum success. In recent years, the concept of student-curated high school curriculum has been gaining momentum as an answer to the question of how to increase student participation in learning. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum.

Allowing students to have control of their curriculum means empowering them to explore and engage in subjects that interest them, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the subject. This approach fosters autonomy, self-discipline, and motivation among students. Students are more likely to engage in their studies if they feel they have a say in the matter. Furthermore, students will not have to aspire for a future direction based on a narrow set of knowledge. Instead, they would be able to explore their passions and discover new ones. In this way, student-curated curriculum enhances their creativity and innovative skills which will be a valuable asset to them in the future.

The system of student-curated curriculum can benefit schools as well. In traditional methods of education, teachers design the curriculum, so students have less input. The student-curated method involves collaboration between students and teachers, which can lead to a stronger teacher-student relationship. Teachers can learn more about the students' interests and aspirations and offer guidance on how it aligns with academics.

However, there are drawbacks to this approach. A concern is that students may select too few subjects without awareness of the subjects necessary for future schooling and job prospects. A lack of exposure to certain essential subjects may lead to gaps in knowledge. In addition, students' choices may be limited by factors such as academic prerequisites, availability of resources such as textbooks, and the extent of the school's infrastructure. As a result, it is vital for schools to have a framework for student-curated curriculum that allows for flexibility without comprising educational standards.

Another potential disadvantage of student-curated curriculum is the possibility of resistance from some teachers. Teachers might feel uncomfortable with the concept of students choosing their courses and may resist the idea because it disrupts their traditional teaching style. However, if implemented effectively, student-curated curriculum can lead to a positive and meaningful educational experience for both parties involved.

In conclusion, student-curated high school curriculum can offer several benefits, including increased student engagement and autonomy, the development of creativity and innovation skills, and stronger relationships between students and teachers. However, several potential drawbacks to this approach exist, such as lack of exposure to essential subjects and resistance from teachers. It is important for schools to develop a flexible framework that allows for student input while maintaining academic standards so that students can realize their full potential in their academic pursuits and beyond.
