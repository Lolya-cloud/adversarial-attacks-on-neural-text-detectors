When I was in high school, I often wondered why I had to take certain classes that didn't interest me and felt like a waste of time. It made me realize that the school curriculum was designed to fit the standards set by the education board, and we had no say in what we learned during our high school years. This has led me to think about whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

The education system is designed to provide a set standard of learning, but every individual has different interests and passions. Allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum can help them pursue their interests and passions, leading to higher engagement and better learning outcomes. Students can select courses that they find challenging and motivating, leading to better success rates.

Moreover, curating the high school curriculum can be beneficial to students who want to pursue a specific career path. Certain high school courses can be crucial to a student's future ambitions, and allowing them to choose these courses can be decisive in their career choices. Providing students with a customized curriculum can open up more possibilities and opportunities for them to succeed.

However, some may argue that allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum can lead to a lack of diversity and limit their learning experience. There is always a possibility that students may select courses that are too narrow and limit their exposure to different subjects. Without broader exposure, students may lack a comprehensive understanding of different disciplines, limiting their future professional options.

It is evident that striking a balance is crucial when it comes to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Giving students complete freedom may not be an ideal approach. Instead, the curriculum should encompass an element of student choice, with general core courses that students must take to provide a broader understanding of different disciplines.

As a student, I would have loved the opportunity to create my own high school curriculum. I was interested in creative writing, and I found that English classes didn't provide me with the creative challenge I was looking for. I would have loved to take courses that focused specifically on creative writing to hone my skills and pursue my passion.

In conclusion, high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum to a certain extent. It is essential to have a combination of standard core courses and the option for students to choose elective courses that cater to their individual needs and interests. Allowing students to take ownership of their learning experience can lead to better engagement, motivation, and outcomes. It is time for educators to give students the agency to make their own decisions and provide them with a customized education system that promotes success and diversity.
