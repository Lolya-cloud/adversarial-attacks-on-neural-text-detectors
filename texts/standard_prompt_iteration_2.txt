With the traditional educational system, students are often presented with structured course contents they have no choice but to learn. However, in this modern era, new methods of education are being introduced that focus on personalized learning. This is where students have the power to curate their high school curriculum. The question that arises is whether students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum or not. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of students curating their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum empowers them with the ability to learn at their own pace and in a manner that suits them. Students learn best when they are interested in what they are studying, and this is possible when they have the freedom to choose. By choosing their own subjects and topics, students can explore their interests, skills, and passions, and focus on what they enjoy learning best.

Moreover, curating the curriculum can help students to develop self-discipline and responsibility. When students are given the freedom to create their own curriculum, they are also expected to take responsibility for their own learning progress. This is important as it prepares students for college and the workforce, where they will be responsible for their own learning outcomes.

Another benefit of students curating their own curriculum is that it can better prepare them for real-world situations. Many workplaces require individuals who are self-directed, proactive, and able to manage their own time and workloads. When students curate their own high school curriculum, they are already learning skills that will be useful in the workforce. Also, by having access to a personalized education system, students will be much more prepared to face the challenges and complexities of the real world, which is constantly changing and requires individuals to be flexible and adaptable.

Despite the benefits, there are also some drawbacks to allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum. One of the biggest disadvantages is that students may choose easier subjects and topics, favoring certain subjects over others. This can limit their learning and the broadening of their perspectives on different subjects, leading to a lack of diverse knowledge. Additionally, some students may misuse the freedom provided to engage in activities not related to their learning, which may negatively affect their academic progress.

Furthermore, curating one’s own curriculum may not work for all students. Some students may not know what subjects or skills they need to learn, or may not have a clear idea of their future career aspirations. In such cases, students may benefit from a structured curriculum that equips them with knowledge and skills that will be useful in a broad range of careers.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their own high school curriculum has its advantages and disadvantages. While it can provide students with personalized learning, helps develop self-discipline and allows them to explore their interests, the possibility of students choosing easier subjects may limit their learning. Nevertheless, it is worth considering such a system, as it can help students prepare for their real-world experiences. Ultimately, it is up to educational institutions to judge whether the system will work for their students and curriculum, and to what extent the freedom to curate one’s own curriculum can be incorporated into the mainstream education system.
