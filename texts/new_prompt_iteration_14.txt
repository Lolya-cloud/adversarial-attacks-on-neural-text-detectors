As a student myself, I believe that school students should be given the freedom to curate their own high school curriculum. Currently, the curriculum is decided upon by the school board and is mandatory for all students to follow. However, this one size fits all approach may not always cater to the diverse needs and interests of students.

Firstly, allowing students to have a say in their curriculum would encourage them to take ownership of their education. Studies have shown that when students have a choice over what they learn, they are more likely to be engaged and invested in their studies. When passion is ignited, learning ceases to be a chore, and instead becomes a source of personal fulfilment.

Moreover, every student has unique interests and talents that should be encouraged and developed. Without appropriate channels to cultivate these interests, students may feel discouraged and unenthusiastic about their education. For example, a student who is musically inclined may feel stifled by a curriculum that does not offer adequate music classes, causing them to not perform up to their true potential. By allowing students to curate their own curriculum, they will be more likely to pursue their interests, leading to a more fulfilling high school experience.

However, some may argue that the current system ensures that all students are exposed to a well-rounded education. While it is true that the current curriculum aims to provide a comprehensive education, it does not necessarily cater to the diverse needs and interests of students. Additionally, with the rapid advancements in technology and the changing workforce, the current education system may not be adequately preparing students for the real world.

Therefore, allowing students to curate their own curriculum could help ensure that they receive an education that is relevant and well-suited to their needs. By allowing students to choose from a range of subjects and topics that align with their interests and aspirations, we may be able to cultivate a generation of young people who are more equipped to face the challenges of the real world.

Of course, allowing students to curate their own curriculum comes with its own set of challenges. How can schools ensure that students are making informed choices when it comes to their education? How can we ensure that students are exposed to a diverse range of topics and subjects without falling into the trap of just sticking to their comfort zones?

While these questions need to be addressed, I believe that they do not outweigh the benefits of allowing students to curate their own curriculum. In fact, by involving students in the process of designing their education, we may be able to foster a culture of collaboration and innovation that is sorely needed in today's society.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that school students should be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum. It would give them the freedom to pursue their passions and develop their strengths, leading to a more engaging and fulfilling high school experience. While it comes with its own set of challenges, the benefits far outweigh the risks, and we should seriously consider implementing such a system to ensure that our education system is relevant and well-suited to the needs of the 21st century.
