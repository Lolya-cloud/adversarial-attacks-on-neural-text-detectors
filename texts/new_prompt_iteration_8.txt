As a student who has gone through the traditional high school curriculum, I often find myself wondering if there was a better way to approach education. The thought of being able to choose the subjects that I would study genuinely excites me. It would allow me to explore my interests and develop skills that I value while still acquiring fundamental knowledge that is necessary for success in life. Therefore, I believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

The fundamental basis for education is to impart knowledge and skills that will enable students to lead successful lives. However, the current high school curriculum does not always consider the unique interests and goals of each student. As a result, students may often feel disengaged from the material being taught, leading to boredom and less-than-ideal performance in school.

Curating a personalized high school curriculum offers a solution to this problem. Students have a better understanding of their personal interests, passions, and goals. Curating their curriculum will enable them to explore those interests in-depth and take courses relevant to their ambitions. It will ensure that students invest their time and energy in education that is relevant to them and that they will end up valuing and retaining the knowledge gained.

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum represents a significant shift in the current educational system's mindset from being one-size-fits-all to customized for individuals. This change in approach will not only interest more students in education, but it will also help students develop problem-solving abilities and self-awareness.

One significant concern with personalizing high school curriculums is that students might overlook essential subjects that they may not see as relevant or interesting to their interests. However, this concern is not valid - it is beneficial to allow students to personalize their high school curriculum while ensuring that it still covers essential fundamental knowledge that is necessary for students to be well-rounded. Schools should provide a list of essential subjects that students must take as part of their curriculum to prepare them for their future and challenges that can arise in life.

Some may argue that curating a curriculum may lead to over-specialization, wherein students choose only subjects that align with their interests and career aspirations. However, this should not be a concern because high schools still offer a vast selection of courses that students can take outside of their areas of interest.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum offers a unique approach to education that can increase student engagement and academic performance. By offering students more choice and control over their high school education, schools can create young leaders with interests, passions, and educational backgrounds that are valuable in today's society. By encouraging high school students to pursue their academic and career aspirations, schools will be preparing their students better for the workforce, leading to happy and fulfilled lives.
