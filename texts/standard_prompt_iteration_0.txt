Education is an essential aspect of life. It is a foundation that builds students' knowledge, skills, and prepares them for their future endeavors. High school is a critical phase in a student's academic journey, as they begin to explore their strengths, interests, and future career prospects. However, traditional high school curriculums may not cater to all students' individual needs, which may hinder their academic potential. Therefore, the question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is a hot topic of debate. 

On the one hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would provide them with greater flexibility and autonomy over their academic journey. It would enable students to take courses that align with their interests, passion, and future career prospects. For instance, a student interested in pursuing a career in medicine may choose to study more science subjects such as biology, chemistry, and physics. In contrast, a student who aims to become a writer may focus more on taking literature, creative writing, journalism, and communication courses. Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may spark a sense of creativity, innovation, and critical thinking within them. Students are more likely to take ownership of their learning process when they have some control over the subjects they study, leading to an increase in motivation and engagement levels. 

On the other hand, some may argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may narrow their academic horizons. It may prevent students from taking courses that they may need for their future career prospects or potential college majors, leading to an academic disadvantage. For instance, a student interested in pursuing a career in law may need to take courses such as economics, government, and philosophy, even if they find it less interesting than other subjects. Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may lead to an unbalanced education, where students focus too much attention on specific subjects and lack a well-rounded education. 

Despite the potential challenges that may arise from allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, the benefits outweigh the costs. By granting students more flexibility and autonomy over their academic journey, students are more likely to take ownership of their learning process, leading to an overall increase in motivation and engagement levels. Moreover, allowing students to choose courses that align with their interests, passion, and future career prospects may help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, leading to better college and career decisions. 

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum may have significant benefits in increasing student motivation, engagement, and individuality. While there may be potential challenges, the advantages of allowing students more flexibility and autonomy in their academic journey seem to outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore, a student's right to choose their high school curriculum should be granted, provided that it aligns with their future career prospects and college majors. It's time to acknowledge that every student is unique with different strengths and interests, and it's only fair to give them the power to shape their futures.
