The need for education is fundamental to the growth and development of any individual. Schools play an essential role in providing education to students, which further leads to the creation of a responsible, knowledgeable, and competent society. However, there is a continuous debate regarding whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum or not. Some people argue that students should have the autonomy to choose their courses, while others contend that it should remain the prerogative of the education board. In my opinion, school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the main reasons why students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is the need for a personalized education system. All students are different in their capabilities, interests, and learning styles. A standardized and rigid curriculum fails to cater to these individual differences. An educational system that allows students to choose their courses based on their interests and abilities can promote personalized learning, reduce the burden of education, and enable students to optimize their learning outcomes. Moreover, a personalized curriculum can contribute to better retention rates, reduce dropout rates, and foster a sense of ownership and responsibility towards learning.

Another reason why schools should allow students to curate their high school curriculum is that it promotes creativity and innovation. Often, innovative and creative ideas come from unexpected areas and individuals who approach problems from a different angle. Allowing students to choose their courses and design their education can help them explore their creative potential and find innovative ways to acquire knowledge. By promoting creativity and innovation, we can prepare students for the fast-paced and ever-changing job market and enable them to develop skill sets that are highly valued in the current economy.

The argument against allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it may lead to an unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. The critics suggest that those with privileged backgrounds will fare better than their counterparts, who may lack resources and guidance. However, this can be countered by offering adequate support to students who might need it. School administrators can develop a framework that includes a range of options and guidance that enables students to make informed decisions, regardless of their background.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum empowers them with high levels of responsibility and decision-making skills. This skillset contributes to their transition from high school to college and into the workforce. By giving them autonomy and empowering them to make informed choices, high school education can act as a confidence-building exercise that equips them with the skills necessary to succeed in life.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can facilitate personalized learning, promote creativity and innovation, empower students with decision-making skills, and prepare them for the workforce. By providing adequate resources and guidance, schools can ensure that the benefits of personalized education extend to all their students and prepare them for a fulfilling and successful life. Although some might argue that the idea of student-curated learning is untested and could lead to a potential educational crisis, the potential outcomes are likely to outweigh the risks. The time for a personalized, student-based learning approach is now.
