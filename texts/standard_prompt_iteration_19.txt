High school education is a crucial stepping stone in the lives of students. It sets the foundation for their higher education and professional careers. While traditional curriculums are designed to cater to the needs of the majority, they seldom address the specific needs, interests, and abilities of individual students. This leaves the students feeling uninspired and disinterested in their education. Allowing students to curate their curriculum can provide them with autonomy and help them discover their passion and potential.

When students have the freedom to design their courses, they become more invested in their education as they can identify with the subjects they are learning. Most students find the existing curriculum to be monotonous and unchallenging. By giving them the power to choose what they want to learn, the classes become more engaging, stimulating, and relevant. This can help to reduce truancy rates and provide better educational outcomes, including higher test scores, greater student satisfaction, and improved critical thinking skills.

Personalizing the curriculum can also address the issue of low teacher effectiveness in high schools. With limited resources and overcrowded classrooms, teachers often cannot cater to individual student learning styles. When students can choose their classes, they are more engaged, which in turn creates better student-teacher relationships. This enables teachers to better understand the students' specific challenges, which allows them to offer more targeted support and guidance.

Furthermore, student-led curriculums can provide more educational opportunities for students. They can take classes that are not typically offered or are only offered in other locations. For instance, if a student has a passion for photography, they can curate their photography courses rather than simply settling for the generic photography courses. This autonomy can catalyze creativity and innovation, which ultimately leads to an enriched educational experience.

The current curriculum focuses mainly on academic subjects and tends to overlook vocational and life skills that are essential for students to succeed in the professional world. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, they can opt for vocational courses such as carpentry, plumbing, or programming. These classes can provide them with hands-on experience which is often useful in various professions. It can also provide them with valuable life skills such as time management, budgeting, and critical thinking.

However, it is crucial to ensure that students' choices are not limited to their areas of interest as this can create gaps in their education and development. To prevent this, the school administration can provide advisors to guide students in making the appropriate choices based on their skills, academics, and future goals. This guidance enables students to build well-rounded curriculums that balance their interests and proficiencies with areas pertinent to their academic and professional pursuits.

It is no secret that the traditional education system is outdated and rigid. The world is changing at an unprecedented rate, and it's essential for students to adapt to these changes to succeed professionally and academically. By allowing students to curate their high schools' curriculums, they can make learning more personal and tailored to their needs, which helps them discover their passion and potential. In a rapidly evolving world, a self-designed curriculum can foster creativity, promote innovation and provide vital life skills that are necessary for students to thrive in life. Thus, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum should be considered an essential ingredient in reforming the education sector.
