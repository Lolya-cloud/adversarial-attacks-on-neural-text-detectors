As a student, I believe that school curriculums should welcome student input. Allowing students to curate their academic programs would mean more personalized education, increased engagement, and motivation. But, some might argue that students’ selections might lack academic rigour or might miss out on traditional subjects.

What’s wrong with the current high school curriculum? School curriculums tend to be standardized and focused on academic goals. Individual choices based on interest, learning style, and extracurricular activities may not always find their way into the curriculum. In high school, students usually face overloaded schedules with a rigid structure that barely leaves room for exploration. Allowing them to curate their curriculum would mean more time to focus on subjects that interest them.

On the other hand, some might wonder, wouldn't allowing students to choose their curriculum lead to shortcuts and neglecting essential subjects like English, mathematics, and others? Not necessarily so. Students know the importance of core subjects, even if it is not their favorite subject. Additionally, students who decide to skip certain subjects altogether would miss out on the overall learning experience and reduce chances of landing on their desired career path.

In my experience, I remember struggling in math class despite putting a lot of effort into it. If I could curate some of my classes, I would have opted for classes centered on writing and art instead of maths. Customizing my coursework would have made school feel more meaningful and rewarding.

School life can take its toll on students, and letting them curate their studies could provide a sense of control over their academic lives. Engaging in learning activities that fascinate students increases motivation and extrinsic rewards. If students can draw links between topics they learn and their passion, they’ll retain and apply the information for longer.

Moreover, student-led curriculum customization promotes a sense of responsibility and decision-making skills. Students will assume role models in their learning journeys and prioritize their education while being accountable to themselves ultimately. Ensuring that students have the freedom to decide the courses they take prepares them to make choices beyond the classroom.

Consequently, allowing high school students to choose their curriculum would help them foster a stronger bond with their teachers. Teachers’ responsiveness to students’ interests, aspirations, and extracurricular activities would strengthen the teacher-student relationship and ultimately enable better academic performance. It also helps teachers discover the students’ strengths and areas for improvement and engage them in individualized and diversified learning methodologies.

One challenge that arises when students are allowed to choose their curriculum is equal opportunities. Some students have a higher likelihood of selecting more challenging courses while others might prefer easy or fun classes. Assessing each student's level of academic readiness and offering counseling sessions before making a decision would help cater to each student's level and interest.

In conclusion, allowing students to customize their curriculum to their interests and passions is a step in the right direction. The current school curriculum should not determine a student's future career, and providing students with flexibility and choice helps diversify students' skills and aptitude. But, it's crucial to strike a balance when it comes to academic rigour and what students want from the curriculum. The freedom to customize school curriculums would help students engage better in learning activities, foster a sense of responsibility, and promote teacher-student bonding.
