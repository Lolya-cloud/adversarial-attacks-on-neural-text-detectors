Education plays a vital role in shaping a student's future. It is considered the foundation of one's academic and professional development. However, in recent years, there has been a growing debate about the effectiveness of the traditional education system. Critics argue that the education system needs to be more student-centric to cater to each student's individual learning needs, abilities, and interests. One proposed solution to this problem is allowing high school students to curate their curriculum. In this essay, we will explore the benefits and drawbacks of letting students curate their high school curriculum.

To begin with, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum will provide them with the flexibility to choose subjects of their preferences. Students will have the freedom to explore topics that interest them, leading to a more engaged and motivated force of learners. This personalized approach will also help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to have a clearer idea of their future career paths. Moreover, students can select courses that emphasize practical skills-based learning, such as coding, finance, or graphic design. This initiative will equip them with life skills that they can apply in their future professional careers.

The question remains, how can the education system ensure the integrity and relevance of courses offered if students are in charge of selecting them? First, schools can provide a range of necessary courses that students must take to fulfill essential academic requirements. Second, the selection process can be overseen by guidance counselors, teachers, and academic advisors to ensure that students' choices align with their prospects and interests. Consequently, curating one's curriculum can lead to a more comprehensive and diverse set of educational experiences.

However, some critics argue that curating high school curricula can lead to unequal opportunities and a lack of academic rigor. Students may choose subjects that are easy or outside of their comfort zones, leading to poor academic results. Additionally, students may opt for courses based on personal interests instead of academic significance, leading to an unbalanced curriculum. Therefore, skeptics argue that a standardized curriculum is in place to ensure a level playing field for all students. However, this argument overlooks the differences among students that standardization will not address. Therefore, the solution is to offer a balance between standardization and flexibility, empowering students to have more control over their education while maintaining academic standards.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can have a positive impact on mental health and well-being. The traditional education system is often too focused on academic achievement, leading to a stressful and overwhelming environment for students. By granting them agency over their education, students can prioritize their mental health and well-being by striking a healthy balance between academic rigor and personal interests. Additionally, this initiative can help reduce the pressure for students to measure their self-worth solely based on academic performance.

In conclusion, curating the high school curriculum presents both opportunities and challenges. The personalized learning approach can lead to a more engaged and motivated student body. Nonetheless, maintaining academic rigor and ensuring academic relevance is crucial in the process. While standardization can address these issues, granting students more control over their educational experiences will foster a more diverse and comprehensive set of skills. The education system should strive towards offering a balance between standardization and flexibility, ultimately fostering a more supportive environment that allows students to thrive academically and personally.
