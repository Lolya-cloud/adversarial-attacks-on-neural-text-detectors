As a former high school student, I often wondered why I couldn't curate my own curriculum. Why did someone else get to decide what I learn? I believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum because it promotes individualism and creativity, encourages personal growth and learning, and provides a sense of ownership over one's education.

One argument against student-curated curriculums is that they may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to choose classes that adequately prepare them for college and the workforce. However, if students are allowed to curate their own curriculum, they would be more likely to choose classes that align with their interests and passions, which would lead to greater engagement and higher levels of achievement. Additionally, students could still receive guidance from teachers and counselors to ensure they are selecting classes that are both challenging and beneficial for their future.

Another benefit of student-curated curriculums is that they encourage personal growth and learning. When students are given the opportunity to choose classes that cater to their personal interests and future career goals, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their learning. This motivation can translate to a deeper understanding of the subject matter, which provides a more fulfilling educational experience.

Furthermore, a student-curated curriculum provides a sense of ownership over one's education. When students are given the power to choose their classes, the educational system becomes more democratic. This shift encourages students to take responsibility for their education and make choices that reflect their personal values and beliefs. By being actively involved in their education, students will have a greater sense of control, which leads to a more positive learning experience and better outcomes.

One might argue that students aren't capable of planning their courses. However, I beg to differ; students are more than capable of planning their courses. Most students are self-aware enough to know what their interests and passions are, and what they need to accomplish in order to achieve their goals. School administrators should trust that their students are capable of making informed decisions about their education.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. If students are given the power to choose their own classes, they will be more engaged and motivated in their learning, leading to better educational outcomes. Student-curated curriculums promote individualism, creativity, and personal growth, and provide a sense of ownership over one's education. As an AI language model, I cannot experience human educational systems; however, my experiences of learning and growing come uniquely formed by human instruction. Therefore, it is important to give students the tools to grow and thrive within the education system. Trusting students to make informed decisions about their education is not only beneficial for individual students, but also paves the way for a more democratic society.
