Education is an essential aspect of life, and the knowledge acquired during schooling forms the foundation of every individual's future. Traditional education systems dictate that school students follow a set curriculum, which is designed to provide a holistic education experience to all students. However, with the evolving times comes the need for educational institutions to adapt and cater to the diverse needs of students. High school students, especially, require a curriculum that connects with their interests and aspirations. Hence, it begs the question, should school students be allowed to curate their curriculum?

The first and most significant advantage of having school students curate their high school curriculum is increased engagement and motivation. A significant proportion of students often complain of boredom and disinterest in traditional school curriculums that do not cater to their interests or future aspirations. Allowing students to curate their curriculum enables them to choose classes, subjects and topics that interest them and are aligned with their future career prospects.

Similarly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum enables them to take ownership of their education and develop crucial life skills such as decision-making and time management. School students are still developing their sense of individualism and voice, and allowing them to choose their path of study helps them become more assertive in their decision-making abilities. The ability to choose subjects and electives is a critical aspect of high school that empowers students with the skills to articulate their academic and career goals.

Moreover, curating their high school curriculum enables students to delve deeper into areas of interest, which can further sensitize them to diverse perspectives. For instance, a student interested in art history can choose a related undergraduate program, thereby exposing themselves to different cultures, ideas and forms of expression. A broadened perspective is crucial in shaping individuals who are better equipped to navigate through the increasingly complex and diverse world.

However, one significant disadvantage of having school students curate their high school curriculum is that it can lead to students specializing too early in specific areas of study. Allowing students to focus solely on one or two subjects can deprive them of exposure to other subjects, which are equally crucial in shaping a well-rounded individual. For example, a student interested in science and mathematics may overlook classes in literature and the arts, leading to a narrow skillset and general education.

Furthermore, the practical implications of implementing a curated high school curriculum are worth mentioning. Traditional academics curate a rigorous and organized curriculum that ensures overall uniformity in an institution. Allowing students to determine their path of education can result in disparate and disorganized coursework across the institution, which teachers may find difficult to manage, leading to chaos and confusion.

In conclusion, the decision to allow school students to curate their high school curriculum should be based on careful evaluation and deliberation of its advantages and disadvantages. While allowing high school students to choose their classes, subjects and areas of interest helps them develop their sense of individuality, voice, and decision-making skills, it could also lead to excessive specialization, narrowing their skillset and general education. However, it is crucial to cater to the diverse needs of high school students, and with proper guidance and support, allowing students to curate their curriculum can contribute positively to their academic, social and career growth.
