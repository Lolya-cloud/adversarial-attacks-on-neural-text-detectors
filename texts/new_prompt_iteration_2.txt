Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? This is a question that has been debated for years, with valid arguments on both sides. As someone who has recently completed high school, I have some personal reflections and insights on this topic.

On one hand, there are those who argue that students lack the knowledge and experience to understand what is necessary for their education. They argue that leaving the curriculum decisions to students would lead to an unbalanced and inadequate education. However, I would argue that this view is flawed. Students spend a significant amount of time in the classrooms and interact with the curriculum every day. They are the ones experiencing the teaching materials firsthand, which makes them the most qualified to determine what works for them.

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would provide an opportunity for them to choose courses that best suit their interests, abilities, and future career goals. It would enable students to take ownership of their education and choose courses that keep them engaged and motivated. This could result in higher student retention rates, student performance, and overall student satisfaction. Additionally, students could explore subjects that they are passionate about, which could lead to career exploration and discovery.

Curating high school courses could also provide an opportunity for students to personalize their learning experience. One student's interest may be in the sciences, while another may prefer literature. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would provide them with the ability to explore their interests while still meeting core curriculum requirements. The customization of high school education would provide an added level of motivation for students who thrive in an individualized and flexible learning environment.

The idea of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may seem too radical, but in reality, it is not a new concept. High schools already offer some form of elective coursework that allows students to pick from a limited selection of courses. However, the coursework is limited in scope, and students' choices are limited to the available options. By providing a broader range of courses, students could have access to courses that go beyond traditional subject matters or traditional teaching methods.

One possible counter-argument is that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to less emphasis on crucial educational skills. There is a concern that students may only lean towards courses that interest them the most and overlook some basic courses that are critical for their future success. However, a curriculum that is curated by students could include creative integration of essential skills like critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. By instilling these skills in students early on, they are better prepared for their future careers and other challenges they may face in life.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to significant positive changes. Students would have the freedom to explore their interests, develop specialized skills, and take ownership of their education. It is time to seriously consider providing students with an opportunity to create a personalized learning experience in high school. It may be a different approach to education, but it is a step in the right direction towards a more well-rounded and fulfilling education.
