As students, we spend most of our youth in school, and yet the curriculum that we learn is often decided by administrators, politicians and other education officials, rather than ourselves. However, with the advent of new technologies and teaching methods, the idea of allowing students to have more agency over their curriculum has gained increasing support. In this essay, I argue that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum as it can increase engagement and motivation, allow for more personalized learning, and foster critical thinking skills.

One of the main benefits of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is increased engagement and motivation. When students have limited say in what they learn, they may feel uninterested or disconnected from their studies. However, when students are able to choose the topics they are interested in, they may be more eager to learn and engage with the material. For instance, if a student is passionate about environmentalism, they may be more motivated to learn about climate change and conservation practices. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, we can help to nurture their interests and passions, rather than stifling them.

Another benefit is that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can allow for more personalized learning. Not every student learns in the same way, and some may benefit from more hands-on activities, while others may prefer reading from textbooks or watching videos. By allowing students to choose how they learn and what they learn, we can create a more individualized educational experience. This can also help to address the achievement gap in education, as students who may struggle in traditional classroom settings can learn in a way that is best suited to their learning style.

Moreover, curating one's own curriculum can foster critical thinking skills. When students are allowed to choose their topics, they may be forced to consider multiple perspectives and analyze different sources of information. For example, if a student chooses to learn about the history of a particular conflict or war, they may read opposing viewpoints and analyze primary sources to form their own opinion. This type of learning can help to develop critical thinking skills, which are essential for success in many careers, as well as in both personal and professional relationships.

However, while allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may seem like an ideal solution, there are potential downsides to consider. One concern is whether students may neglect fundamental subjects such as mathematics or English. Additionally, some students may not be ready or mature enough to make informed decisions about their education. However, these concerns can be addressed by implementing proper guidance and resources to help students make informed choices. It is important to remember that allowing students to curate their curriculum does not mean that all core subjects are excluded, but rather that students have the opportunity to explore elective courses that cater to their interests.

In conclusion, school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. It can increase engagement and motivation, allow for more personalized learning, and foster critical thinking skills. Rather than forcing students to follow a one-size-fits-all curriculum, we can create an educational environment that nurtures students' interests and passions. By doing so, we can help to ensure that students are motivated, engaged, and excited about their education, which ultimately leads to lifelong learning.
