It's no secret that teenagers can be incredibly passionate about their interests. Some students have a singular focus, whether it's music, art, or science, while others may have a more eclectic range of passions. Yet high schools across the country offer a standard curriculum, with a set of required classes that students must take in order to graduate. This system has been in place for decades, but many are starting to question if this is truly the best way to educate and inspire young minds. Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? 

On the surface, it seems like a great idea. Why shouldn't students be able to choose courses that align with their interests? If a student is passionate about a particular subject, they will be more engaged and motivated to learn. This would lead to better educational outcomes and a higher rate of success. 

However, there are some potential issues that could arise from allowing students to curate their curriculum. For one, students may not have a clear idea of what they need in order to be well-rounded and have an education that can prepare them for the workforce. Additionally, students may choose courses that are too easy or are not aligned with their future goals. 

Personally, I feel torn about this issue. On one hand, I remember how frustrated I was in high school that I wasn't able to choose my classes. I had to take a foreign language, even though I wasn't interested in it, and I didn't have time to take all the advanced science classes that I was interested in. On the other hand, I don't know if I would have been able to make the best choices for myself at that age. 

Rhetorical question- wouldn't it be great if there was a way to combine the benefits of both systems? 

One potential solution is to offer more flexibility in required classes. Instead of mandating specific courses, schools could allow students to choose from a range of options that all satisfy the same requirement. For example, students could choose between taking a foreign language, a coding class, or a business class. This way, students would still be required to meet certain standards, but they would have more agency in how they achieve those goals. 

Some may argue that this approach could lead to a lack of standardization, and that colleges and employers would have trouble evaluating students from different high schools. However, if schools were required to offer a set of courses that satisfy the same standard, students would still be held to the same expectations. It would just allow them to choose the path that they feel is the best fit for them. 

In conclusion, I believe that some level of student choice in high school curriculum is a good idea. Students should be able to pursue their passions, and this can be done without sacrificing educational standards or preparation for adulthood. By offering more flexibility and options within required classes, schools can create an environment where students are empowered to take control of their learning. Ultimately, the goal of education should be to inspire and equip students for a successful future, and a curriculum that reflects their interests is one way to achieve that goal.
