As students progress through their academic careers, there are many things that they would like to change about their curriculum and high school education. But, unfortunately, the current educational system does not allow students to have such liberties even though they know best what works for them. Students should be given the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum as it will empower them to take ownership of their education and create a personalized learning experience that fosters growth and development.

One of the primary reasons why students should be able to curate their own high school curriculum is that it helps to foster a sense of ownership for their education. When students have the ability to choose what they learn and how they want to learn it, they become more invested in their education. They begin to feel like they are part of the process and that their education is something that they have control over. This, in turn, leads to higher levels of motivation, engagement, and performance. By giving students a voice in their education, they are more likely to be successful in their academic pursuits.

Another benefit of allowing students to curate their own curriculum is that it provides a more personalized learning experience. Each student is unique, and they have different interests, passions, and learning styles. A one-size-fits-all approach to education does not work for everyone and can be detrimental to the learning process. By allowing students to choose what they want to learn, they can create a curriculum that is tailored to their individual needs.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum will prepare them for the real world. In the real world, adults have the freedom to choose what they want to learn and how they want to learn it. By giving students this opportunity in high school, we are preparing them for the future. It will also help them to develop skills that are necessary for success in the workforce such as decision making, time management, and problem-solving.

Of course, it is important to note that giving students the power to curate their own high school curriculum does not mean that they should be left on their own without guidance. The role of teachers and administrators is still important in this process. They can help guide students in their decision making and provide support when needed.

There are, of course, potential drawbacks to allowing students to curate their own curriculum. One potential issue is that students might not choose subjects that are essential for their future careers. However, schools can provide guidance to ensure that students choose a balanced curriculum that includes the core subjects that are necessary for their future success.

In conclusion, high school curriculums should be curated with the students in mind if they are to be efficient. Allowing students to curate their own curriculum will lead to higher levels of motivation, engagement, and performance, and provide them with a more personalized learning experience. It will also prepare them for the real world, fostering the development of critical skills necessary for future success. Therefore, schools should empower students to take ownership of their education by giving them the opportunity to curate their own high school curriculum. It is a small step towards creating a more student-centered educational system.
