The education system has changed significantly over the years, and there is an increasing interest in giving students more control over their high school curriculum. Advocates of student-curated education believe that it provides personalized and engaging learning opportunities, helping students to feel a greater sense of ownership and motivation in their studies. However, there are also concerns about the effectiveness of this approach and the potential for students to miss out on important subjects or essential skills. In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum and conclude with a clear position on the issue.

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum offers several advantages. Firstly, it gives them the opportunity to pursue their interests and passions. One-size-fits-all curriculum cannot accommodate all the diverse interests, talents, and career aspirations of students. When given the freedom to select courses, they are more likely to take subjects they are enthusiastic about, leading to greater enjoyment and a better learning outcome. Students will have a greater sense of agency over their education, making them more responsible, proactive, and independent.

Furthermore, student-curated education fosters critical thinking and decision-making skills. They will have to consider their options, evaluate the usefulness of each subject, and choose the courses that best align with their goals. This process nurtures students' skills in analyzing information, problem-solving, and weighing options, skills that are essential for their post-high school life. Students will learn to take ownership of their path and seek advice from teachers, counselors, and parents, making them better equipped to make independent decisions in the future.

Despite the advantages, several concerns exist regarding student-curated education. Perhaps the most noted is the risk that students might miss out on essential subjects or not be challenged enough academically. Students may be tempted to take only easy subjects, leaving them unprepared for college or the workforce. Additionally, students may be at a disadvantage when applying to colleges or universities that require specific courses to be completed before admission. This risk can be mitigated by providing advisors who guide students through the selection process and ensure that they take the essential courses.

Another potential problem is the inequitable distribution of resources, including funding and teaching, among schools or regions. Students from low-income backgrounds may not have the same opportunities to select specialized courses as those from wealthier schools. This can exacerbate the existing achievement gap, where some students already have fewer resources and opportunities than others. Still, this can be mitigated by investing in resources and infrastructure that will enable students to access the courses they choose.

In conclusion, student-curated education has several benefits that can significantly enhance the quality of learning and the outlook of high school students. However, this approach must be carefully implemented to ensure that essential subjects are taken, and all students have access to the same resources and opportunities. Advisors should be provided to guide the process and ensure an equitable distribution of resources. In the end, high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum because it positively impacts their education experience, improves their motivation, and contributes to the development of essential skills.
