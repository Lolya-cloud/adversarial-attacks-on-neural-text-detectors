As a student myself, the idea of being able to curate my high school curriculum seems exhilarating. The idea of being able to choose my own subjects not only excites me, but it also allows me to tailor my academic journey to my individual needs and interests. However, the question remains: should high school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

For starters, the current education system often fails to cater adequately to the needs and interests of students. In many cases, high school students are required to take mandatory classes which may have no relevance or interest to them. As a result, many students end up losing motivation and interest in their academic pursuits. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to take classes that are interesting and relevant to them, thus promoting a more engaged, motivated and fulfilled learning experience.

Another compelling argument for allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is that it would help create a more personalized educational experience. Every student is unique, with their own distinct interests and learning needs. Allowing students to take ownership of their learning pathway will not only promote a more personalized experience but can also help boost morale and self-confidence. For example, a student interested in engineering could choose to take advanced physics courses in high school to better prepare them for future college courses. This sense of agency can go a long way in preparing students for the future and creating a sense of responsibility and self-worth.

However, the notion of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is not without its challenges. When given complete control of their education, some students may opt for classes that are less rigorous or not sufficiently challenging. This may lead to gaps in their academic knowledge, therefore making it more difficult to excel later in their academic career. Additionally, not all high schools have the resources or capacity to offer a wide range of classes, making it hard for students to find courses that pique their interest.

Despite these potential challenges, the benefits of student-led curriculum far outweigh the possible drawbacks. One solution would be to provide students with mentorship and guidance from experienced educators, helping students make informed decisions about their curriculum and its potential outcomes. This guidance could also help ensure that students are continually challenging themselves to reach their fullest potential, even when making creative choices.

In conclusion, the notion of high school students curating their curriculum holds enormous potential. Not only does it promote a more personalized and fulfilling educational experience but it also sets students up with crucial skills of self-awareness, independence and accountability. Giving students agency over their education could help them learn to make informed decisions, take charge of their own learning journey, and better prepare them for their adult lives. That said, it's important to remember that implementing such a revolutionary change would require diligence, caution, and thoughtful planning. Yet, with the right guidance and support, I firmly believe high school students would thrive with such a level of control over their education.
