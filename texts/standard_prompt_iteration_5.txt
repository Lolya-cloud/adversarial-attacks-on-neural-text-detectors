The current high school education system is designed to teach students the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in their chosen field of work or further education. However, the curriculum is often pre-determined by the school board and lacks flexibility, leaving some students feeling unmotivated or disengaged from their studies. Therefore, there is an increasing debate on whether high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum to better suit their individual learning needs and interests.

On one hand, allowing students to have more control over their curriculum can lead to a more personalized education experience, increasing their motivation and engagement in their studies. Students can choose subjects that align with their interests, passions, and career goals, leading to a clearer understanding of their future path and potentially improving academic performance. It also encourages students to become active learners who seek out knowledge for their own benefit rather than passively absorbing information for exams.

Moreover, students who have the freedom to choose their curriculum are more likely to take ownership of their education and develop important skills like communication, problem-solving, and decision-making. These abilities are crucial in college, the workforce, and in daily life. Allowing students to make their own decisions in their academic careers gives them a chance to develop these essential life skills.

On the other hand, one of the main concerns is that students may make poor decisions when selecting their courses, leaving them with gaps in their knowledge and skills required for college education or a future career. Additionally, some students may face pressure from parents or peers, leading them to make choices based on external factors rather than personal interest or career goals.

Furthermore, providing students with too much freedom to curate their curriculum can lead to a disjointed and unstructured educational experience, which may not prepare them for the realities of college or the workforce. While the current system may be flawed, it is still designed to provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in the future. Departing too far from this structure may hinder studentsâ€™ opportunities in the long run.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum has its benefits and challenges. Providing more freedom to students can lead to a more enriching and personalized learning experience. The students will have a clear understanding of their future goals, become active learners, and develop important life skills. However, it is essential to keep a balance between flexibility and structure, ensuring that students remain well-rounded and prepared for college and the workforce. With the right framework, allowing students to take more ownership of their education has the potential to promote academic and personal development.
