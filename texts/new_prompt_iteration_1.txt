Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? It's an interesting question that raises many different arguments on both sides. On one hand, students are the ones who are in school, so they should have control over what they learn. On the other hand, teachers and other professionals have specific expertise that they can impart to students. In this essay, I argue that a balance can be achieved by allowing students to have some say in their high school curriculum.

As someone who went through the high school system in the United States, I remember feeling frustrated at times with the lack of control I had over what I was learning. Of course, there were electives that allowed me to choose my own classes, but for the most part, my required courses were predetermined by the school district. It often felt like I was just going through the motions, trying to get good grades so I could move on to college. I would have welcomed the opportunity to have more control over my education.

So, what kinds of changes could be made to give students more control over their high school curriculum? For one thing, students could be given more options when it comes to required classes. Instead of having a one-size-fits-all approach where everyone takes the same courses, students could be allowed to choose from a menu of options that cover the same curriculum. For example, if a school requires its students to take a certain number of science courses, students could choose from classes like biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, or anatomy and physiology. This would allow students to tailor their education to their interests and strengths, which could lead to greater engagement and better outcomes.

Another way to give students more control over their high school curriculum is to allow them to design their own projects or assignments. This approach would require more work on the part of teachers, who would need to be flexible enough to accommodate a variety of projects, but it could also lead to more creativity and engagement from students. For example, instead of writing a traditional essay on a topic, students could be allowed to create a video, podcast, or infographic that presents their ideas in a different way. This would give students more freedom to express themselves and showcase their unique talents.

Of course, there are limits to how much control students should have over their high school curriculum. There are certain skills and knowledge that students need to learn in order to be successful in college and beyond. Additionally, teachers and other professionals have a wealth of knowledge and expertise that they can impart to students. It's important to strike a balance between giving students autonomy and ensuring that they are learning the skills and knowledge that they need to succeed.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum can be a positive step forward in education. By giving students more choices and opportunities to express themselves, we can create a more engaged and motivated student body. However, we must also recognize the limitations of this approach and make sure that students are still learning the skills and knowledge that they need to succeed. Ultimately, a balance between student autonomy and expert guidance can lead to the best outcomes for everyone involved.
