The idea of allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people believe that students should have complete control over the courses they choose to take, while others argue that this can lead to students missing out on important subject areas. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against students curating their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their curriculum can be beneficial in that it gives them the opportunity to explore their interests and passions. Students who are passionate about a particular subject, such as music or art, could choose to take more courses in this area and develop their skills. This can have a positive effect on their confidence and motivation towards learning.

In addition, allowing students to curate their curriculum can provide them with a sense of ownership and responsibility for their education. Students are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn when they feel that they have a say in what they are studying. This can lead to better academic performance and increased retention rates.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to implementing this approach. One concern is that some students may choose not to take important subject areas, such as math or science, which are essential for success in many professions. This can limit their future career options and opportunities for higher education.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their curriculum could create an unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. Students who come from affluent backgrounds may have more access to resources and support to pursue their chosen courses, while those from less privileged backgrounds could miss out on essential opportunities.

Another potential challenge is that some students may struggle to make informed decisions about their curriculum. They may not have a clear understanding of what courses are necessary to achieve their future goals or may be influenced by popular trends rather than their genuine interests.

To address these concerns, there could be measures put in place to support students in making informed decisions about their curriculum. This could include guidance from counselors or teachers, as well as educational resources to help students understand the potential implications of their choices.

In conclusion, while there are some potential benefits to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, this approach also comes with risks and challenges. It is essential to find a balance between giving students autonomy over their education while ensuring that they have access to a well-rounded and comprehensive curriculum. Ultimately, the goal should be to help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed academically, professionally and personally.
