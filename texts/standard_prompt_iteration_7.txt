Education is undoubtedly a critical aspect of our lives, and it is essential that we provide our students with the best possible knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their future careers or goals. However, the existing education system in many countries has been criticized for being too rigid and not giving students enough options to choose subjects they are interested in. This has led to a debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this approach and conclude with my opinion.

One benefit of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it would give them more autonomy and control over their education. Rather than having to follow a predetermined set of courses, students would be able to choose subjects that interest them or that align with their career aspirations. This could be especially beneficial for students who have a particular passion or talent that isn't necessarily catered to by the current curriculum. A broader range of courses could also attract more students to higher education, stimulating the economy.

Another potential advantage is the ability to tailor a student's education to meet their individual needs. Some students may require additional support in areas such as mathematics or English, whilst others may excel in these areas and have no interest in pursuing them further. Allowing students to curate their curriculum would enable schools to provide a more tailored and personalized experience, enhancing outcomes and advancing academic excellence.

Despite these potential benefits, there are also several disadvantages to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Firstly, it is essential to consider whether students have sufficient knowledge or experience to make informed decisions about their education. In many cases, young people can lack knowledge or information to make the best decisions, and there can be a tendency to choose courses based on peer pressure or socialization, rather than on their abilities and aptitudes.

Another disadvantage is that there may be subject areas that are under-subscribed or unpopular amongst students. It would not be appropriate to penalize those subject areas that are essential but less popular, and the system wouldn't provide an even distribution of knowledge and skills for all students.

In conclusion, providing students with the ability to curate their high school curriculum through an effective program that is overseen by education professionals and addresses the concerns outlined would provide many benefits. It would enable students to take ownership of their education, enabling them to follow their passions and develop a diverse range of skills. The key to its successful implementation, however, would be to ensure that students have sufficient guidance, support, and resources to make informed decisions that feed into a wider curriculum involving mandatory subjects alongside those chosen by the student. Overall, I believe that it is a pathway worth exploring, providing the necessary infrastructure and support framework can be established.
