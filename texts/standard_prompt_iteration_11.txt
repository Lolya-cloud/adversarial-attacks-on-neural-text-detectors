One of the main goals of formal education is to impart knowledge and skills that will be useful to students in their future lives. However, the one-size-fits-all approach in education has led to dissatisfaction and unfulfilled needs of students. Therefore, the question arises whether students should have a say in their high school curriculum.

The idea of student-led education is not new, but it has only gained prominence in recent years. Giving students the freedom to decide their academic itinerary comes with advantages and disadvantages. The major advantage is that it allows students to pursue subjects that interest them and align with their future aspirations. It is no secret that a lot of high schools only offer a limited number of subjects and seldom give students the opportunity to specialize. Therefore, allowing students to curate their educational program would give them a chance to explore topics that they genuinely love, which can result in better academic performance and satisfaction.

Moreover, being able to decide their curriculum would also instill a sense of responsibility and accountability in students that can shape them into future leaders. As they learn to make choices and face their consequences, they become more independent thinkers and mature individuals. This way, students are not just passive recipients of education but active participants.

On the other hand, allowing students to choose their curriculum can also pose significant challenges. Firstly, not all students have the same depth of knowledge in different subjects. Therefore, for them to choose subjects they wish to learn on their own could lead to knowledge gaps and other unwanted outcomes. This is especially true for subjects that are critical to their future success. Also, the temptation to pick subjects that are comfortable to them rather than one that they genuinely need can be a disadvantage. The obvious danger is that students may end up limiting themselves and miss out on critical learning opportunities that could be essential in their future careers.

Moreover, different schools have different curricula requirements. Students who wish to curate their courses would need to familiarize themselves with different academic institutions' rules and regulations and ensure they adhere to them. This can be a daunting task for them as they may need extensive research and consultations with education personnel. This new responsibility can be overwhelming and difficult to manage alongside their academic commitments, leading to mental stress.

Additionally, teachers may not always agree with students' choices, even though they are relevant to their future careers. Therefore, it can create academic friction that can be problematic for both the student and teacher. This is particularly evident in elite schools, where the set curriculum is of high quality and is aimed at producing high performers. As a result, a shift towards student-led education could lead to a drop in academic standards and ultimately harm the institution's reputation.

In conclusion, giving students the chance to curate their education is a complex issue that requires a careful evaluation of its potential advantages and disadvantages. While there are many potential benefits, such as greater personalization, student accountability, and satisfaction, there are also possible drawbacks, such as limiting opportunities, lack of standardization, and conflicts with teachers, and administrative staff. Therefore, the decision to allow students to curate their school curriculum should be made after careful consideration of all these factors.
