Students have been passive recipients of education for far too long. They have been taught what to learn, how to learn, and when to learn. Education has been a one-way street, with teachers and school authorities deciding what students should study. However, over time, students have become more aware of their needs and have sought for an active role in designing their education. Students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Curating high school education will help students to meet their specific needs and interests. Students come from different backgrounds, with different aspirations and career goals. Each has their set of abilities and weaknesses. For example, a student who has a passion for music may not need to study advanced mathematics. Alternatively, a student who wants to pursue finance may not need to be an expert in literature or history. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will help design an education that is tailored to their needs and interests, making it more meaningful and engaging.

Furthermore, curating a high school education will help students prepare for the real world. After high school, students may face different professional and personal challenges that require different skills and knowledge. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will help them to identify their strengths and weaknesses and prepare themselves for what is to come. The curriculum should be built around the practical aspects of life, what students should know about finances, how to start a business or get a job or other topics are more beneficial.

Another reason why students should be allowed to curate their high school education is to foster ownership and accountability. Most students today are passive learners who do not have a sense of ownership in their education. They lack motivation and interest in their studies because they feel like they have no choice in their education. Allowing students to curate their high school education empowers them to take ownership and responsibility for their education. When students are given responsibility for their learning, they are more likely to engage more actively and excel.

However, there are potential challenges that may arise when students are given the freedom to curate their high school education. The main challenge can be ensuring that the curriculum is still meeting state standards and preparing students for college, university, or trade school. To mitigate these risks, a committee can be formed. This committee will consist of the teachers, school administrators, and students. This committee will monitor that students are following the state standards and creating engaging, meaningful, and successful lessons.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. It can help students meet their specific needs and interests, prepare them for the real world, and foster ownership and accountability. Finally, the committee structure can help to ensure that students receive a high-quality education that also fulfills state standards and prepares them for their future.
