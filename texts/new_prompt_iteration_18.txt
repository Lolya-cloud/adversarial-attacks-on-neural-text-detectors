The traditional approach to high school education is that students have little, if any, control over what they learn. Classes are chosen for them, along with a set curriculum that they must follow. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to allow students more say in what they study and the projects they undertake. This approach is often referred to as student-led learning. While there are pros and cons to this approach, it is my belief that high school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

One argument for student-led learning is that it gives students agency over their education. As someone who graduated from high school just a few years ago, I recall feeling frustrated when I had to take courses that I had no interest in or that I felt were irrelevant to my future goals. It was disheartening to realize that I had little control over the direction of my education. If students were given more control over what they learn, they could tailor their education to their interests and passions and be more invested in their studies. This could lead to a more meaningful learning experience and a higher level of motivation.

Another benefit of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it promotes innovation. When students are encouraged to pursue subjects that they are passionate about, they are more likely to think creatively and develop new ideas. For example, if a student is interested in environmental science, they may choose to design a project that explores ways to reduce plastic waste in their local community. This type of project could lead to the development of new solutions and could inspire others to take action.

Despite the benefits of student-led learning, there are also valid concerns. For example, if students are given too much control over their education, they might miss important foundational skills or knowledge. Additionally, some students might choose to avoid challenging or difficult subjects if they are given complete freedom over their curriculum.

To address these concerns, it is important to find a balance between student-led learning and traditional classroom instruction. For example, students could be given a few core classes that they must take in order to ensure they have a solid foundation of knowledge, but then be given the freedom to take elective courses in areas that interest them. Additionally, teachers can work with students to develop learning goals and objectives, and provide guidance and support as needed.

In conclusion, student-led learning is a promising approach to high school education that has the potential to improve the learning experience for students. By giving students more control over what they learn, we can promote agency, innovation, and a deeper level of engagement. However, it is important to balance this approach with traditional classroom instruction to ensure that students receive a well-rounded education. Ultimately, the goal of education should be to prepare students for the future, and giving them more control over their curriculum is an important step in achieving that goal.
