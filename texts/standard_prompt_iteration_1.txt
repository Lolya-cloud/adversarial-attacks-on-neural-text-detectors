Education is one of the most important aspects of a young person's life, and high school is a critical stage in this journey towards intellectual and personal growth. Therefore, it is important that students have a say in the courses they take as it helps them discover their interests and passions, which positively contributes to their life satisfaction.

There are strong arguments in favor of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum. One of the most self-evident benefits of this approach is that students will have more control over their academic journey. Traditional education models often have students follow a predetermined course list that often includes topics that arenâ€™t interesting to many of them. This often results in teenagers losing interest in school which can lead to problems like dropout rates and absenteeism. Directing students to study classes that actually interest them not only makes classes more engaging, but it can also promote mental health and reduce stress levels, driving better academic performance and success rates.

The ability to customize their high school education can also foster a sense of empowerment, responsibility, and autonomy. When students make decisions regarding their education, it helps them develop decision-making skills that will serve them in life beyond high school. By selecting their courses, project topics, assignments, and schedules, teenagers learn the value of responsibility and accountability as they take full ownership of their academic work in school. They can better estimate their own strengths and weaknesses, be more aware of their potential, and learn to use these talents effectively to their advantage.

Another aspect that supports student-led curation of high school curriculums is that students have varied interests. Education institutions must ensure that they cater to different types of learners, and allowing students to select their courses aligned with their learning styles and interests provides flexibility, which develops a broader range of talents. It helps them explore new skills, generate fresh knowledge, and discover new passions. As a result, students may understand themselves better and can achieve better careers and, by extension, better lives.

While there are several benefits to enabling high-school students to curate their own curriculum, opponents argue that implementing such a program may cause confusion in terms of standards and requirements that are necessary for college preparation. A one-size-fits-all approach to curriculum development can miss opportunities for increased student engagement. However, all high schools will still be required to offer basic core classes such as science, math, social studies, language arts, and physical education. Students would also have to meet these core requirements, although they could still be allowed to choose specialized versions of them that match their potential career choices.

In conclusion, it would be beneficial to offer students the freedom to curate their high school curriculum. It is both practical and beneficial since students will be able to actively participate in their studies, develop decision-making skills, and have the freedom to prepare for their future careers. While there are concerns about academic standards and discipline, a student-led curriculum would not completely abandon academic standards and necessary core subjects. Instead, it would allow students to explore their passions, enabling them to discover what they love and find the path that is right for them. Through this approach, teenagers will learn to develop academically sound but meaningful educational journeys that lead to the self-discovery of their true, authentic selves.
