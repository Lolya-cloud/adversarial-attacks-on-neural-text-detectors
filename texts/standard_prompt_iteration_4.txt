High school education lays a foundation for a student’s future, and it comprehensively shapes their perspective towards life. But with a standard curriculum, most students do not have the opportunity to choose the subjects they want to study, creating a disconnect between them and their education. Therefore, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is warranted, as it will help them tailor their education to their individual needs, thus benefiting both students and the educational system.

Allowing high school students to curate their curriculum will help them focus on subjects they are passionate about, and it will enhance their learning experience. For instance, students with a passion for science, art, or literature might find math or history uninteresting and difficult to comprehend. Therefore, allowing a student to choose their course of study will help the student concentrate on subjects that interest them, aiding them to learn the material thoroughly. This approach will also let students have diverse learning experiences, given that everyone has their learning styles and preferences. Thus, students can take the initiative to broaden their knowledge, helping them build a better foundation for tertiary education and their future.

Curating a high school curriculum has the potential to create skilled professionals. Allowing students to choose their courses of study will enable them to specialize in their preferred areas, leading to the development of in-depth knowledge and skills in a particular field. For instance, an aspiring engineer or a programmer might want to concentrate entirely on mathematics and computer science subjects. Students with variable interests might want to choose an interdisciplinary course of study, enhancing their proficiency in different fields simultaneously. Providing students with such flexibility has the potential to create skilled professionals, giving them an edge in the job market and when pursuing higher education.

Allowing high school students to shape their curriculum will lead to better academic results. Most students disengage from learning when they sense the material is forced on them, causing poor academic performance. On the other hand, giving them the liberty to make choices regarding subjects they want to study will improve the quality of education delivery. When students have higher emotional intelligence, they tend to perform better academically. Therefore, allowing students to tailor their education to their preferred learning style will lead to better academic results, as demonstrated by the improved academic performance of those who study specialized programs.

However, negative implications might accompany allowing high school students to curate their curriculum. Firstly, students might select the subjects they enjoy, but neglect core subjects required by the school board. This approach could potentially lead to a knowledge gap, which might hinder future success. Secondly, students’ poor decision-making skills might impact their choice regarding courses of study, leading to a lack of balance in their academic growth. To overcome these potential implications, students need guidance from educators and parents, as well as monitoring.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum has numerous benefits. It will enable students to concentrate on subjects they are passionate about, develop in-depth knowledge about a particular field, and improve their academic performance. However, necessary monitoring and guidance are important to prevent students from neglecting critical subjects required for their academic success in school and the future. It is a debate worth considering seriously and one that could significantly benefit both students and the educational system.
