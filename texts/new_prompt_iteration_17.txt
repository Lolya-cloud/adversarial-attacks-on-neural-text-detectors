As an AI language model, I have no personal reflection. However, I can write an essay on the topic 'Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?'.

The question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is one that has been debated for years. On the one hand, some argue that students should have a say in what they learn to help them stay engaged and find a subject they are passionate about. On the other hand, critics of this approach argue that students lack the maturity and foresight required to make such important decisions.

It is essential to consider the benefits of student involvement in the high school curriculum. Firstly, students have different passions, interests, and career aspirations. Giving them the freedom to select their courses can help personalize learning and motivate them to engage with their studies. Secondly, it fosters critical thinking skills. Students learn about the topics that interest them, giving them more opportunities to apply concepts in real-world situations. Thirdly, it can help to bridge the gap between high school and college. College students are given much more freedom to choose their courses, so having high school students curate some of their studies can help to prepare them for higher education.

However, there are legitimate concerns about allowing students to select their curricula. One fear is that students will choose only to study courses that they enjoy, to the detriment of a well-rounded education. Moreover, students may not select courses that would prepare them for careers that require multiple disciplines. This approach could also create more work for teachers, who would need to create many different course pathways.

Additionally, the question of whether students want to select their curricula without input from teachers must be considered. While some students may relish the freedom to choose for themselves, some may find it daunting and prefer to receive guidance.

It is understandable why some people might be cautious about allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Still, it is essential to consider that teachers and schools could set guidelines for students' choices to avoid possible educational gaps. They could, for example, permit every student to choose up to two elective subjects based on their interests while ensuring they also have a balanced core curriculum.

Finally, it is essential to foster trust in students and to recognize them as responsible, mature individuals. By giving high school students the freedom and power to choose their curriculum, we are teaching them responsibility and independence, qualities that will serve them well in their academic and professional lives.

In conclusion, student involvement in curating their high school curriculum is a critical but delicate issue. There are potential benefits and drawbacks to this mechanism. In hindsight, one way to mitigate possible risks and support student autonomy in education is to establish guidelines to prevent students from limiting themselves educationally. Nonetheless, the debate is an essential one to ensure that students receive an education tailored to their individual interests and goals.
