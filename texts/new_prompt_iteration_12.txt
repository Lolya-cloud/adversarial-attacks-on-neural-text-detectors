As a student, have you ever felt bored with the subjects in your curriculum? Have you ever wished you could choose the courses you want to learn? Well, the debate on whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum has been a topic of discussion for a long time. In my opinion, students should be given the freedom to choose the courses they want to study. The idea of students curating their high school curriculum holds a lot of merits that can benefit both the students and the education system. 

The traditional high school curriculum provides a standard set of courses that every student has to learn. However, there are students with unique talents and interests that are not indulged by the traditional curriculum. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would provide these students with an opportunity to specialize in their area of interest. For instance, a student interested in coding and computer science can choose these courses in detail, while still covering the core subjects. 

Furthermore, a student who is interested in entrepreneurship can tailor their curriculum to include courses that enrich their knowledge in this area, such as business, economics, and marketing courses. Allowing students to choose their courses can help them to develop new skills, nurture their talents, and explore different career paths, leading to higher chances of success in the future.

On the other hand, students can also select courses that challenge them and improve their critical thinking skills. They can take courses that are not part of the traditional curriculum, which cultivates their creativity and curiosity. However, there is a need for the students to be responsible when curating their curriculum by ensuring they select the appropriate mix of subjects that will enable them to meet the scholastic requirements

Moreover, the freedom to curate one's curriculum in high school can be beneficial to educators as well. It allows the teachers to focus on students' diverse talents, insights, and abilities. When students have the opportunity to choose courses, teachers can tailor their teaching styles to fit the students' individual interests and needs, leading to a more enjoyable and tailored learning experience.

While some people argue that freedom of choice can lead to disorganization and an easier path for students, I believe it is important to trust students to make their own choices. They are mature enough to make informed decisions that will benefit them in the long run. Education should not be a one-way street as it is not effective. Students are more likely to thrive when they are motivated, interested, and engaged in the courses they are undertaking, therefore, curating their curriculum will be the best way to meet each student's needs.

In conclusion, high school students should be given the freedom to choose the courses they wish to take. It will enable them to refine their talents and explore different career paths. Educators will learn how to tailor their teaching styles to fit the students' level of understanding, and, in the end, students will have a more enjoyable and tailored learning experience. While there are some cons to allowing students to curate their curriculum, the benefits are far more significant than allowing students to be inhibited by traditional methods. Therefore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will be an essential step in ensuring that every student receives an education that fits their needs.
