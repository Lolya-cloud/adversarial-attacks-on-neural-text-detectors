The death sentence or capital punishment remains a highly debated and controversial topic globally. Many countries have abolished it, while others still implement it. The question is, should the death sentence be implemented globally?

There are several reasons why the death sentence should be implemented globally, but before we delve into that argument, we must first consider the purpose of the death penalty. The primary purpose of the death penalty is to deter murder and other heinous crimes. Taking someone’s life should never be taken lightly, but sometimes it is necessary to maintain a civil society.

One of the most compelling arguments in favor of the death penalty is that it serves as a powerful deterrent to crime. Capital punishment sends a clear message that the state will not tolerate violent criminal behavior. It also sends a message to would-be criminals that the consequences of their actions will be severe.

Furthermore, the death penalty is necessary to show the sanctity of human life. Human life should be respected, and individuals should be held accountable for their actions. By implementing the death penalty, we reinforce the idea that individuals must take responsibility for their actions and face the consequences of their behavior.

Another argument in favor of the death penalty is that it is a just punishment for those who have committed heinous crimes. For example, in cases of mass murder or terrorism, it is only natural to want to see the perpetrator punished severely. The death penalty provides a sense of closure for victims’ families and helps to bring a sense of justice to society as a whole.

However, the arguments against the death penalty cannot be ignored. One of the most prominent arguments is that it violates human rights. The right to life is fundamental, and the death penalty is seen as a violation of that right. Moreover, the death penalty has been proven to be racially biased, with minorities being disproportionately sentenced to death.

Another argument against the death penalty is that it is not a deterrent. Many studies have shown that there is no evidence to support the idea that the death penalty deters crime. In fact, some evidence suggests that it may even increase crime in certain circumstances.

Lastly, the death penalty is sometimes wrongly implemented, leading to innocent individuals being sentenced to death. There have been several cases where DNA evidence has exonerated individuals who were previously sentenced to death. This risk of executing an innocent person is unacceptable and has been the driving force behind many countries’ decisions to abolish the death penalty.

In conclusion, the death sentence is a highly debated topic, and it is a complex issue with convincing arguments on both sides. However, it should be implemented globally as it serves as a powerful deterrent to crime, reinforces the sanctity of human life, and provides a just punishment for heinous crimes. Nonetheless, it is important to ensure that it is implemented fairly, and that no innocent person is executed. The death penalty should always be considered as a last resort, but in some cases, it may be necessary to maintain law and order and to protect innocent lives.
