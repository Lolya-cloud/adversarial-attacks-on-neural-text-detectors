The issue of students curating their high school curriculum is a topic that has been widely debated. However, the question remains, should school students be allowed to choose courses that they feel interested in and those that align with their career goals? This essay argues that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. 

High school is a crucial stage in a student's academic development. It is a time when young people explore the world around them and try to understand the subjects that they are taught. But education has evolved, and the traditional approach that prescribed the same curriculum has become outdated. Students are unique, and their interests, learning styles, and career goals are diverse. Therefore, students need a curriculum that aligns with their individualized needs.

The benefits of allowing students to curate their curriculum are numerous. Firstly, such freedom allows the students to take courses that align with their career goals. For instance, a student interested in pursuing a career in medicine would benefit significantly from a biology course. Allowing students to curate their curriculum would enable them to take courses that provide them with the skills and knowledge that would be useful in their future careers. 

Secondly, curriculum freedom provides the students with a sense of ownership of their education. When students are allowed to choose their courses, they become more invested in their studies. Furthermore, they feel more motivated to learn when they have the freedom to decide which courses they want to take. Therefore, students that curate their curriculum tend to be more engaged and perform excellently in their studies.

Additionally, giving students the freedom to curate their curriculum prepares them for life after school. The real world is full of autonomy, and allowing students to make independent decisions regarding their studies prepares them for the future. Such skills are essential, especially when it comes to making career choices and navigating through life.

However, while allowing students to curate their curriculum has several benefits, some challenges need to be addressed. Firstly, students may lack the necessary knowledge to choose the courses that align with their interests and future career goals. To overcome this challenge, high school counselors could guide the students in making informed decisions regarding their course choices. This way, students can take courses that are relevant to their future careers.

Secondly, students may choose courses that do not align with their interests but are easy to pass. Such behavior may result in a lack of diversity in the curriculum leading to the students missing out on significant knowledge in other areas. To avoid this situation, schools should encourage students to take courses that align with their interests while promoting intellectual curiosity and challenging themselves academically. 

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has numerous benefits that provide a personalized learning experience that meets their individualized needs and goals. Students that curate their curriculum tend to be more engaged, motivated and perform better in their studies. As such, high schools should allow students the freedom to choose courses that align with their career goals and interests while addressing the challenges that come with such freedom.
