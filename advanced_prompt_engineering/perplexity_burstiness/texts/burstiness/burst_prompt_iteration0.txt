As a student of high school, the curriculum often feels stifling and restricting. There is a sense that all students are expected to learn the same things in the same way, stifling any creative approach to education. This leads to a growing rebellion among young people for the right to curate their high school curriculum. The question arises, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? The answer is a complex one that takes into account many different factors.

On the one hand, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum can lead to greater engagement with education. Students are more likely to be interested in learning when they can have a say in what they learn. They can pick topics that they are interested in, and they can learn about those topics in a way that makes sense to them. This approach can be especially helpful for students who struggle with traditional teaching methods.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their curriculum can build a greater sense of ownership and pride in their work. When students have a say in what they learn, they are more likely to feel invested in that learning. They are more likely to take ownership of their education, putting in more effort and care into their assignments. This can lead to a stronger sense of pride and accomplishment when they succeed.

On the other hand, the idea of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can pose a great challenge to the quality of education. If students are allowed too much freedom in what they learn, they may miss out on important foundational information that is necessary to succeeding in higher education. Some of the topics that students may pick may not be useful in their future careers, which may harm their chances of further success both academically and in their careers.

Additionally, giving students complete freedom to curate their high school curriculum can also lead to theoretical gaps in their education. It is often the case that students do not have the necessary pre-requisite knowledge to fully appreciate more advanced or specialized subjects. This means that an unguided curriculum may lead to significant gaps in the knowledge of many students.

In conclusion, there are pros and cons to both sides of the argument on whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. Allowing students the freedom and flexibility to personalize their learning experience can undoubtedly offer many benefits, such as increased engagement and pride in their work. On the other hand, there are inherent challenges associated with allowing students to take control of their education, which can lead to a potentially theoretical gap in their learning and hurt their chances of higher education and future career success. In the end, it is essential to balance freedom with structure to ensure that students get the best of both worlds.

In light of these facts, it is essential that schools take an inclusive approach to their curriculum building. They should not merely provide students with a set curriculum but also offer opportunities for students to take control of their educational journey. This might include access to electives and personalized learning opportunities. Educators may even implement personalized, student-directed initiatives as well. In the end, a healthy balance of structure and freedom is essential to maximize the overall efficiency of the school curriculum.
