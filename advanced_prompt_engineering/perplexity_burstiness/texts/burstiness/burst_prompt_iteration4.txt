In the current educational setup, students spend a significant amount of time in high school, gaining foundational knowledge to prepare them for college and beyond. However, not all students have the same interests or educational goals. Therefore, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? This question has stirred a lot of debates, with some supporting and others opposing the idea. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum.

On the one hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can have many benefits. To begin with, students have the opportunity to tailor their education to their needs or preferences. This means that students can choose the subjects they want to study in-depth while avoiding topics that do not interest or benefit them. This can lead to higher academic performance and success rates because students are more invested in their studies when they can choose what they want to learn.

Secondly, students can take advantage of the opportunity to explore new subjects or skills that they may not have considered before. This exploration can help students to discover their passions, strengths, and weaknesses, leading to better-informed academic decisions. For instance, students can take classes in graphic design, coding, or entrepreneurship, among others, depending on their interests and academic goals.

Additionally, students can take courses in preparation for their desired career paths. For instance, a student planning to pursue a career in medicine might choose to take classes in biology, chemistry, and anatomy. In this way, students can start building their academic and professional credentials early on.

On the other hand, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum can also have some pitfalls. Firstly, it can lead to a lack of academic rigor if students only take courses that are easy for them and avoid more challenging subjects that might be necessary for their career paths. This could mean that students end up unprepared for college or the workforce, leading to poor academic and professional outcomes.

Secondly, students may not have the knowledge or experience to make informed decisions about their curriculum. They may choose subjects based on popular trends or recommendations from their peers rather than considering their long-term educational goals. Moreover, students may lack the breadth of knowledge that comes with studying a wide range of subjects, leading to narrow minds and stunted intellectual growth.

Finally, high school students may have limited resources to curate their curriculum effectively. For instance, smaller schools or schools in low-income areas may not offer a wide range of courses, making it difficult for students to explore different subjects and career paths. Additionally, some students may face pressure from their parents or guardians to take certain classes that align with family expectations rather than their passions and interests.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum can come with both advantages and disadvantages. It is critical to strike a balance between giving students the autonomy to choose their subjects while still ensuring that they receive a rigorous education that prepares them for college and the workforce. Ultimately, it is essential to involve students, parents, teachers, and school administrators in the process of curating the high school curriculum to ensure that students receive the best education possible.
