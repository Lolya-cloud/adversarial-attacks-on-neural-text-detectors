The idea of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum has been debated for a long time. Some argue that it would give students the freedom to choose what they feel would be most beneficial for their future, while others worry that it would lead to a lack of essential skills or knowledge. However, considering the current education system, it is high time that schools allow students to customise their curriculum. 

School students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum for several reasons. First of all, students know best what interests them and what knowledge they wish to gain. The current education system forces students to study subjects that they might not have any interest in or do not feel they need to learn. Allowing students to curate their curriculum would give them the freedom to choose what they want to learn and focus on their interests. Therefore, teachers would have more motivated and engaged students in their classrooms, resulting in increased academic success rates.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to prepare better for their future. Students would have the opportunity to choose subjects required for their future career and higher education, and they will be able to focus on the skills and knowledge that they would need in the long run. This way, students would have more control over their education, and they would be able to create a path that fits their interests and future goals.

Moreover, giving students the opportunity to curate their curriculum would lead to a more personalised education. Each student is different, and thus, requiring students to follow the same curriculum is not possible. Allowing students to choose their courses would take into consideration their strengths and weaknesses, allowing students to receive tailored education. This way, students would be able to learn at their own pace, and the possibility of missing out on important information would be minimal.

However, some argue that if students choose to focus on their interests, they may miss out on essential knowledge or skills. For example, students might choose to study only subjects they like, leaving out subjects that they might not enjoy but need for higher education or real-life situations. However, this problem can quickly be rectified by ensuring that there are certain compulsory subjects that students must take for a well-rounded education. This way, students still have the freedom to study subjects they like, while making sure that they gain all the necessary knowledge and skills.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would lead to a more engaged, motivated, and personalised education. This type of education system caters to the individual needs of each student, and enables them to prepare better for their future and the challenges ahead. Therefore, schools should give students the freedom to choose their courses, while still ensuring that they gain the necessary knowledge and skills required for higher education or real-life situations. By implementing this kind of education system, we can foster a generation of well-informed and empowered students who can take control of their own lives.
