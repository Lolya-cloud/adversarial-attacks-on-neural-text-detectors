There is a longstanding debate about whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. Proponents of this idea argue that it could help students focus on studies that interest them and prepare them for their future careers or college majors. Opponents argue that it is the responsibility of educators to guide students in their studies, preventing them from making potentially harmful choices and ensuring that they receive a well-rounded education.

At the heart of this debate is the question of whether high school students have the maturity to make important decisions about their curriculum. Some argue that high school students are too young and inexperienced to make such decisions and that they need guidance from educators. However, others believe that students should be given more autonomy and freedom to learn about what they are interested in. This debate has been raging for years, and there are valid points on both sides of the argument.

Proponents of student-curated high school curriculums argue that students are better equipped to make informed decisions about their learning when they have the freedom to choose what they study. They believe that this would help foster more interest and engagement in studies, thereby motivating students to learn more. The advocates of student-curated curriculum also argue that the current system of education is too rigid and inflexible, which leads to a lack of creativity and innovation in learning. This could be why students lose interest in studies and regard it as a mind-numbing exercise.

In addition, student-curated curriculums are crucial because they allow students to explore subjects that interest them outside of the traditional academic disciplines. This would give students the opportunity to learn interdisciplinary studies and cutting-edge technologies that are not a part of traditional educational curriculums. In other words, students will be better equipped and have a more robust arsenal of knowledge varied which will prepare them for future careers in their chosen fields.

On the other hand, opponents of student-curated curriculums believe that students are not mature enough to make informed decisions about what they should study. They believe that students are still learning about themselves and that they don't have the life experience necessary to make informed decisions about their future careers or educational majors. And so, they argue that educators should guide students in their learning and ensure that they receive a well-rounded education.

Critics of student-curated curriculums also warn against the dangers of student bias and cherry-picking subjects they feel are easy or less challenging, and ignore the challenging subjects. This will lead to a lack of preparedness and a narrow knowledge base, which could do more harm than good in the long run. In other words, without proper guidance and mentoring, students could develop cognitive tunnel vision that might hamper them when they are faced with more complex academic challenges.

In conclusion, there are valid points on both sides of the debate about student-curated curriculums. While it could be beneficial for students to have more freedom and autonomy over what they study, it is critical that they receive guidance and support from educators to navigate the academic challenges they might encounter in their learning journey. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between student autonomy and mentorship. This way, students can take responsibility for their education while still receiving a well-rounded, diverse education that aligns with their future aspirations and career choices.
