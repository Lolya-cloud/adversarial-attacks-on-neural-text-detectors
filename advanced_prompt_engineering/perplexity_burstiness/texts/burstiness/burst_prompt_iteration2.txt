The traditional approach to education involves students being presented with a pre-determined curriculum of courses that they are required to take in order to progress through the academic system. However, there has been an increasing push for students to have greater control over their own education, including the ability to curate their own high school curriculum. While some argue that this would lead to a more personalized and engaged learning experience, others worry that this approach would result in a lack of cohesion and rigor in the education system.

Proponents of student-led curriculum argue that allowing students to choose their own courses would lead to a more personalized and engaged learning experience. Students would be able to focus on the subjects that they are most interested in, and they would have the flexibility to pursue their own interests and passions. This would lead to higher motivation and engagement, as well as greater creativity and innovation. In addition, students would be able to choose courses that are more applicable to their future career or life goals, rather than being forced to take courses that they may never use or that do not interest them.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their own curriculum would also help to eliminate some of the issues that are associated with the current system. For example, students who are struggling in particular subjects would be able to focus on areas where they need the most help. Additionally, students who are advanced in a particular subject would be able to take more advanced courses, rather than being held back by the pace of the rest of the class. This would help to eliminate boredom and frustration that can lead to drops in motivation and engagement.

However, there are also several potential drawbacks to a student-led curriculum approach. One concern is that students may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to make informed decisions about their educational path. Without the input of experienced educators, students may choose courses that are not rigorous or challenging enough, or that do not cover essential topics or skills. This could lead to a lack of cohesion in the education system, and students may end up with large gaps in their knowledge or skill sets.

Another concern is that a student-led curriculum could lead to a lack of accountability for both students and educators. In the current system, teachers are held responsible for ensuring that their students learn the material and meet certain standards. However, in a system where students are responsible for choosing their own courses, there may not be as much oversight or accountability for either students or teachers. This could lead to lower standards and poorer outcomes overall.

In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum, there are also potential drawbacks that must be considered. Ultimately, any changes to the education system must be made carefully and with input from both students and educators. It may be possible to find a balance between a student-led approach and a more traditional curriculum, but it will require careful planning and consideration. Regardless of the approach taken, it is clear that a focus on personalized and engaged learning is key to preparing students for success in the 21st century.
