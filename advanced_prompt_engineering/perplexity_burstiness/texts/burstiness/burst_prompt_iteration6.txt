The traditional method of education has remained the same for generations. School students are expected to enroll in mandatory subjects that have been pre-determined by the school board. Although this system has worked effectively for numerous years, several education reformers argue that it is time to consider a more student-centered approach. They suggest that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum, as this would enable them to take courses that they are passionate about and enhance their learning experience.

The notion of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has gained significant momentum in recent years. Proponents of this concept argue that it would help students to fully engage in their education since they would not only be choosing courses that interest them, but also courses that suit their particular educational needs. Moreover, students would gain more autonomy and responsibility over their learning process, which would foster a sense of self-motivation and encourage them to take ownership of their education. This, in turn, would help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are paramount for their personal and professional lives.

Another key benefit of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it would provide them with more opportunities to explore their interests and passions. The current system of predetermined courses does not always allow students to take the classes they desire, which can lead to students disengaging from their education and dropping out. Allowing students to choose their courses can prevent this scenario from happening by enabling them to choose classes that suit their interests. This would also allow them to gain more in-depth knowledge in certain areas and help them develop skills that are relevant to their future career aspirations.

However, there are also drawbacks to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. One concern is that students may not have the necessary experience or knowledge to make informed decisions about their education. They may select courses that are easy or not useful for their future, which could hamper their academic progress and future opportunities. The curriculum may end up being skewed, focusing only on popular courses instead of a balanced approach to learning.

Another issue is that allowing students to choose their curriculum could create inequality in education. Students who come from low-income households, or who have limited access to internet and resources, may not have the same opportunities as others to select courses that broaden their educational range. This could lead to a lack of diversity in their education and hinder their overall academic achievements.

In conclusion, the idea of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum has its merits and drawbacks. While it is important to consider that students should have the opportunity to engage in their education and pursue their interests, it is equally important to ensure that such opportunities do not result in a lack of diversity in education, impact student's academic careers negatively or limit their access to opportunities based on their income. Schools must strike a balance between providing students with academic freedom and ensuring that students receive a well-rounded education that is grounded in a solid and balanced curriculum. Only with a good balance between the two can schools provide students with the best educational experience possible.
