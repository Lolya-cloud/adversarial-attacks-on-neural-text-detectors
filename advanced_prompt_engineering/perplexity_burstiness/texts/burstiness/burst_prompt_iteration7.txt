In the current education system, students are expected to conform to a pre-determined curriculum that follows a set outline of what they should learn and when they should learn it. However, as education trends continue to shift toward a more personalized experience, one question that has been raised is whether students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. In my opinion, students should be given this opportunity because it will allow them to develop interest-based learning, positively impact their motivation and help them to succeed better in their future endeavors.

The traditional curriculum is designed to provide a comprehensive knowledge base that is necessary for students to succeed in their future careers. While this model may work for some students, many others struggle to engage with the material and fail to see the relevance of what they are learning. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, we give them the opportunity to take control of their education and align it with their interests, resulting in greater engagement and learning. When students are allowed to pursue their passions, they inherently develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter, as they are more motivated to learn and explore the topic on their own terms.

Another advantage of curating oneâ€™s high school curriculum is the impact this approach can have on student motivation. When students are given the freedom to create their path, they feel more empowered and motivated to immerse themselves in the topic they have chosen. Essentially, they own their education, which leads to greater accountability and higher success rates. Additionally, by empowering students to curate their curriculum, we help them develop a greater sense of responsibility, which is a critical trait to possess in any field.

It's important to note that the opportunity to curate the curriculum should come with some guidelines and parameters. The curriculum chosen should align with the student's future career aspirations, and it's essential to ensure that the education provided remains comprehensive and complete, allowing them to have a strong foundation in the knowledge required to succeed in their chosen career.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curricula could positively impact their academic experience and their future careers. The freedom to choose topics and subjects that align with their interests would enable them to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter, increase their motivation and success, and allows them to effectively become the owners of their educational journey. This personalized education experience will ultimately lead them to a better understanding of the world around them and the role they can play in shaping it.
