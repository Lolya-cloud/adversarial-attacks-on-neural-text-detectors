High school is a time of immense growth and development. It is a time when students start charting out their professional path and begin preparations for higher education. At this point, it is imperative that students should have the right to curate their high school curriculum. Allowing students to create their program can help build better morale and encourage them to take responsibility for their education. In today's fast-paced world, where students are expected to live up to high standards, it is essential to provide them with more control over their studies.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum can help them identify and develop their own interests and passions. When students have the flexibility to select the courses that excite them, they are more likely to be actively engaged in their studies. This raises their academic performance and enhances the learning experience, leading to better grades and increased motivation. Additionally, giving students a chance to specialize in subjects of their choice can help them develop a niche that they would pursue later in life, contributing to their professional growth.

Secondly, student-led curriculum building can provide more personalized learning plans. A significant reason why many students tend to struggle in high school is the rigid, one-size-fits-all education system. Giving students the flexibility to choose courses that align with their goals, abilities, and strengths, helps educators tailor their curriculum to match their needs. This approach helps students avoid the frustrations that come with being compelled to study something they don't enjoy and avoid potential burnout, leading to more effective learning.

Additionally, students choosing the path they want to take can boost their confidence and self-esteem. The mere opportunity to curate their curriculum can give students a sense of control over their future. This sense of empowerment can help them take ownership of their educational and career journeys, instilling self-confidence and independence. As a result, they will become more self-assured and willing to take chances, putting them in a better position to achieve long-term goals.

Critics of student-led curriculum building may argue that it might limit a student's exposure to critical information. However, this is not true. Students are still expected to cover the core subjects, including Mathematics, Sciences and Literature. The only difference is that they get the chance to choose more specialised courses around these disciplines, choosing the ones their interested in. Deciding to focus on a specific area of study helps in-depth exploration and encourages students to take responsibility for their learning.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is an innovative approach that can have a host of benefits. By adopting this personalised learning approach, administrators, educators, and students can work together to create a dynamic, engaging curriculum that better aligns with the students' individual needs, goals and interests. This strategy can enhance student motivation and autonomy, boosting their academic and professional goals. It is high time to ditch the rigid, rigid curriculum structure and place control and freedom in the students' hands.
