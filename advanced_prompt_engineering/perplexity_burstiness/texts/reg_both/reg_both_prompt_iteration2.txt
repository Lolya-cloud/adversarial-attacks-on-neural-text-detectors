The contentious issue of whether high school students should be allowed to personalize their curriculums has been a topic of debate for years and has valid arguments both in favor and against. In my personal opinion, I opine that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could be a positive step towards improving education, provided that certain conditions are met.

Primarily, the allowance of curation would afford students a well-deserved chance to focus on their interests. It has been said that every student has unique strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, molding the learning curriculum to their interests would increase their chances of excelling in academics. Besides, such a customized learning environment will encourage students to be more enthusiastic about their learning experience and improve their chances of success.

Furthermore, the ability to make choices about their education will instill critical decision-making skills in the students, which is highly valuable. By providing them an opportunity to weigh the options, analyze the pros and cons, and then set forth onto their chosen path, such an empowering approach encourages students to take education seriously and invest more in their learning. The end result is that the students are enthralled about their academic journey, thus increasing their chances of success.

Another key benefit of student-curated curriculums is that it encourages a more profound knowledge of particular subjects. For instance, if a student is gearing towards a particular career - say computer science, then allowing them to take computer science-based courses will give them a more in-depth understanding of the field. This way, as they further their academic journey, they can prepare appropriately for the career of their dreams.

Some people believe that allowing students to curate their high school curriculums could lead to a potential lack of diversity in education. However, I believe that it is possible to strike a balance between giving them the freedom to choose, while still maintaining a well-rounded education. It would be essential that the curricular evaluation for the students takes place, and a wide range of electives is available for students to choose from. As such, the students' choices would have to be evaluated to verify that the curriculum reflects a well-rounded education and covers crucial subjects such as mathematics, English, sciences, and social studies.

One of the most compelling reasons for allowing students to personalize their curriculums is that it instills responsibility, decision-making, and a sense of ownership early on. These attributes are critical for success in the work environment, and therefore, there is no better time for students to learn them than right from the beginning.

In essence, I strongly believe that the benefits of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum far outweigh the potential disadvantages. It would create a positive learning environment, push students to take their academics seriously, and instill crucial life skills. However, it is vital that the structure is maintained, regulations are put in place to guarantee key subjects, and students' choices are checked and balanced to ensure a well-rounded curriculum.
