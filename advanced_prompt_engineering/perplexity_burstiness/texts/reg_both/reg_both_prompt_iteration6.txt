The issue of whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum has sparked a debate that divides many educators and students alike. While some believe that the traditional pre-designed curriculum has served its purpose for many years, others argue that its rigid structure is ineffective. With many students struggling to keep up and stay motivated, the question of whether students should have more control over their education is becoming more and more important. 

Allowing students to curate their curriculum has several benefits, proponents argue. By giving them the flexibility to choose which courses, activities or electives interest them, students will be more engaged and motivated in their studies. This, in turn, has the potential to improve their academic success. Furthermore, customized curricula that align with students’ career aspirations will better equip them for real-world employment and future academic pursuits. 

Giving students the power to personalize their learning also fosters a better learning and teaching experience. Students who can select their courses prepare themselves more comprehensively for their chosen career paths, in turn, guiding teachers and schools to offer courses and activities that cater to these interests. As the students express their interests through their personal learning programs, their teachers can redesign their teaching methods to favorably accommodate students’ learning styles, ensuring their academic progression. 

Moreover, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum promotes inclusivity. By selecting courses and topics that have significant impact, students have the opportunity to experience diverse ideas, thoughts, and cultures. This opens doors to broaden students' understanding of unique cultural views, and it facilitates enjoyable class discussions where students exchange ideas from diverse aspects.

Some skeptics contend that allowing high school students to curate their curriculum comes with significant risks. Among them is the fear of underperformance, with students focusing only on what interests them, and ignoring the necessity of a well-rounded education. Additionally, without proper guidance, students may face severe academic and career consequences. There is a risk of missing fundamental knowledge, and future generations may suffer from this long-term risk. However, with comprehensive planning, high schools can limit these risks and ensure that the system proves beneficial. 

In conclusion, the debate whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum has its fair share of supporters and skeptics. While some challenges exist, proponents argue that personalized learning programs tailored to students’ interests, talents, and learning pace will lead to more confident and prepared students. Ultimately, this will contribute to a brighter and more prosperous future. With excellent institution-based planning, customized curricula have a tremendous capacity for success, and it is crucial to maximize the potential benefits while minimizing the risks.
