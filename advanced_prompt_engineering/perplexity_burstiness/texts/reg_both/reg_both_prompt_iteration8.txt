Education serves as the foundation of progress for any society. As such, high school forms a crucial phase in the lives of students before they transition to further education or employment. Unfortunately, current educational systems lack flexibility, perpetuating a uniform curriculum prescribed by school administrations and education boards. While this approach may appeal to academically-inclined students, it may fail to satisfy the needs and ambitions of every high school student. As a solution, there needs to be a shift from the status quo to allow high school students to choose the subjects they study, leading us to ask: should school students curate their high school curriculum?

The emergence of student-curated curriculums avails various advantages. Primarily, it offers students the agency to select subjects based on their interests and career goals. Every student has distinct learning objectives and aspirations, making it impossible for a one-size-fits-all educational approach to meet their unique needs. Allowing students control of their learning leads to the creation of a curriculum plan customized to meet their career aspirations and stimulate their interest, resulting in improved engagement and learning outcomes.

Moreover, curating their curriculum provides students with a holistic approach to learning, which acknowledges the importance of tackling subjects beyond academics. The traditional method of prioritizing rote memorization and test-taking skills neglects crucial life skills like time management, project management, teamwork, and critical thinking, causing students to miss out on valuable experiences. Encouraging student-curated curriculums ensures students acquire a wide range of skills beyond academics, equipping them with tools to overcome real-life challenges.

Furthermore, student-curated curriculums empower students to develop self-awareness and take responsibility for their education. Students will have an opportunity to reflect on their progress, evaluate existing skills and knowledge, and address any learning gaps. Encouraging high school students to take ownership of their education and inspire personal accountability in their education fosters a sense of responsibility, which is beneficial in future endeavors.

Despite the advantages, critics may argue that student-curated curriculums may lead to inconsistent educational standards across different schools. Nonetheless, schools can alleviate the risk by setting criteria and guidance for creating the curriculum. The schools can require students to undertake core subjects such as Social Studies, Mathematics, and English, while elective courses align with their interests. This approach attains a balance between a well-rounded education and freedom of choice.

In conclusion, changing the traditional education landscape and encouraging student-curated curriculums is a much-needed change that optimizes student learning. Empowering students to choose classes based on their passion and goals enables customizability and deepens the connection between learning outcomes and the individual student. Acknowledging that every student has unique needs and interests is fundamental in individualizing learning experiences to produce better outcomes. Altogether, it is time for schools to shift from the conventional curriculum prescribed by school administrations and education boards and adopt a more innovative and personalized curriculum that caters to the diverse needs and interests of its students.
