The education system in most countries typically dictates what students study in school through a pre-determined curriculum. However, a controversial issue has risen on whether students should be empowered to curate their high school curriculum. From my perspective, students should have liberty in choosing their high school courses.

Granting students the power to choose their own high school curriculum could lead to a more personalized education that aligns with their passions and ambitions. No two students are similar in their interests, abilities, or career aspirations, so a one-size-fits-all approach will unlikely cater to every student's individual needs. Consequently, allowing students to curate their high school education would allow them to explore and learn based on what fascinates them. A technology-minded student could opt for a more technology-based curriculum, whereas someone passionate about social sciences could elect courses in history/political science. 

Moreover, the student-led approach would enable students to take accountability and develop critical skills such as decision-making and critical thinking. The process of choosing the courses to tailor their education's direction would require them to express their preferences and research their choices. By taking ownership of their high school curriculum, they would learn vital life skills crucial in several aspects of life.

Additionally, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could broaden their education to diverse areas, creating a more well-rounded education. Besides, many schools focus on core academic subjects besides ignoring others, such as the arts, music, and physical education. By giving students the leeway to curate their high school curriculum, they would have the chance to seek exciting courses beyond what regular curriculums offer. Moreover, they would delve into pertinent social issues, engage in community services, or entrepreneurship that regular curriculums tend to ignore.

Nevertheless, critics raise justified concerns that some students could choose courses that are irrelevant or of no interest to them. However, setting a selection procedure whereby students have some flexibility would solve this issue. Guidance from aptitude tests or academic advisors could assist the students in course selection. Additionally, schools could establish specific graduation requirements to provide students with the necessary academic knowledge and skills.

In summation, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would personalize the experience, provide critical skill sets, present diversity, and lifelong learning. While controversy around the topic still exists, the right guidance and structure could positively impact academic success, student involvement, and engagement.
