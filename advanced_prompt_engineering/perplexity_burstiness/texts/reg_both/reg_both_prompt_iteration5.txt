There has been spirited discussion about whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. Some argue that offering more student autonomy motivates them to remain engaged in their education by fueling passion for their learning. Others contend that granting this freedom ultimately undermines the quality of education. While the benefits of having a curriculum that students have a say in determining cannot be overstated, some drawbacks do exist.

One potential benefit, of course, is that by allowing students to mark their curriculum with their interests and goals, it motivates them to stay engaged in their education. This enhanced engagement is due to the unique set of interests that each student has, and allowing them to choose course materials matching their specific passions. This method can drive them to reach their full potential and gain expertise and specialty in a field they are passionate about.

Furthermore, students may get more relevant training tailored to their targeted career path as a result of having a say in their curriculum. This would not just make education more enjoyable; it would aid students in gaining skills that they may apply in their future career. This would promote growth and competence, leading to more qualified individuals entering the job market.

There are also some drawbacks to allowing students to have control over their own curriculum. Firstly, students may be unable to make wise choices and effectively navigate options. Due to the lack of clarity from them about the future that they want, this potentially leads to their curation being ill-guided, resulting in hampering the development of specific prerequisite skills. It may also lead to cutting corners or trying to create an easier curriculum for themselves, which limits challenge and stifles their personal development.

Secondly, having uniform curricula for all students in a school aids in establishing a sense of community and shared purpose amongst the students. One of the advantages of having a standard curriculum is that everyone gets the same education and can engage in meaningful class discussions. It also fosters an environment where students feel a sense of belonging.

To summarize, both benefits and drawbacks exist to allowing high school students to curate their curriculum. The issue has remained a topic of debate for some time, with no clear consensus. While autonomy can play a vital role in nurturing creativity and igniting passion, it must be executed within a balanced and measured approach to ensure students receive the proper education. To some extent, students need a guide to help make the curriculum relevant and coherent as a whole. While individuality and creativity are encouraged within the parameters already set, the main objective remains preparing students for success in their future endeavors.
