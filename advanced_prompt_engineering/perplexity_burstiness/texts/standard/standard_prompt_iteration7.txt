The traditional high school curriculum has remained largely constant for many years, with standards and requirements set by educational systems governing much of what students must study. However, the question remains: Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

In my opinion, students should be given greater control over their high school curriculum as it allows for personalization of their education, promotes independent thinking and learning, and fosters a greater sense of responsibility and ownership over one's education.

One of the main advantages of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it allows them to tailor their education to their interests and aspirations. A strong connection between a student's individuality and their education can undoubtedly benefit their academic performance. For instance, if a student is passionate about art, they should be given the freedom to choose visual art and design as a course instead of a general art class. This opportunity to select the courses would make learning more engaging, giving them a better sense of academic accomplishment. Besides, students who are passionate about the subjects they are studying are more likely to be motivated to pursue higher education, leading to better career paths.

Another advantage of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it promotes independent thinking and learning. As students must make informed and personalized decisions about their education, they are forced to critically assess their strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Such problem-solving and critical thinking skills are essential for success in both educational and professional settings and can help prepare students for higher education and the workforce. Furthermore, students who take greater responsibility for their education tend to develop greater self-discipline and motivation, key qualities that translate into success in many areas of life.

However, some argue that students do not have the necessary level of experience and knowledge to make informed decisions about their education. While it is true that students' decision-making skills may vary based on their age and experience, current high school students have access to a wealth of information beyond what was available just a decade ago. In addition, most high schools have academic counselors who can guide the decision-making process, providing insights into different course options and potential career paths. These counselors can offer support so that students understand the consequences of their decisions and make informed choices that serve the best interests of their future aspirations.

In conclusion, today's educational system must be as flexible and dynamic as the students it serves. Students should be allowed to take greater ownership of their learning experience, choosing the courses and subjects that genuinely interest and motivate them. By curating their high school curriculum, students can achieve a more personalized education and a deeper connection with their academic experience, which leads to better academic and professional outcomes. As such, the educational systems of today should embrace this approach, creating more opportunities for students to explore their interests and passions and to develop the skills of independence, decision-making, and responsibility.
