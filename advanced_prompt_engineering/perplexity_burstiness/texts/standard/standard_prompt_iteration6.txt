The traditional education system puts students at a disadvantage because it does not give them control over their learning process. The curriculum is set by educators based on what they deem is the most relevant knowledge to impart on their young students. However, as times change, so does the effectiveness of the curriculum. It is no longer tenable that a single institution determines what is good for all students. Therefore, it is time to consider whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. 

The primary reason for allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is to empower them to take ownership of the learning process. When students have a say in what they learn, they become invested in the process, and they are more likely to take it seriously. This sense of ownership is essential, especially when it comes to less engaging materials. Suppose a student finds math more interesting than literature. In that case, they should have the ability to guide their education towards more math-oriented courses, which will encourage them to engage more fully with the learning process. This level of engagement is more likely to result in higher academic achievement and long-term educational success. 

Moreover, student-curation of the high-school curriculum facilitates a more personalized approach to education. Every student is unique, with their strengths, weaknesses, and preferred learning styles. A curriculum that is aimed at providing general knowledge for all students cannot adequately cater to the diverse needs of individuals. Therefore, allowing students to curate creates an avenue for them to personalize their learning, by selecting courses that align with their future career goals or subjects that they find more stimulating. A personalized approach to education ensures that students get the most out of their education, leading to better academic achievement and societal contributions. 

Another advantage of allowing students to curate their curriculum is that it encourages innovation and creativity. When students are allowed to propose coursework, they are required to think critically and creatively and present their ideas effectively. These skills are essential in today's workforce, where innovative ideas are highly valued. When students go through high school without having had the opportunity to showcase their creativity or critical thinking, they are less likely to be able to showcase these qualities when they need them the most. 

On the other hand, critics of student-curation of the curriculum fear that it may lead to the creation of knowledge silos, where students only learn about subjects they are already interested in. This is a valid concern, as it is generally easier to learn about things that one finds engaging. However, the purpose of allowing students to curate their curriculum is not to have a group of well-developed students who are only knowledgeable about a few subjects. Instead, it is about allowing students to take ownership of the learning process and broaden their horizons, all while tailoring the academic content to their interests.  

In conclusion, the traditional approach to education, where the curriculum is set in stone and handed down to students, is outdated and has proven ineffective in promoting long-term academic achievement. High school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum, as it gives them ownership of the learning process, promotes personalization, and encourages creativity and innovation. The benefits that come with this system outweigh the risks of creating knowledge silos. Therefore, educators and policymakers should explore and consider implementing this approach as soon as possible.
