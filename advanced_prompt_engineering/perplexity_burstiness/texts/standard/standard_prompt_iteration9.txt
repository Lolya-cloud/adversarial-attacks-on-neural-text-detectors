As education systems continue to evolve, there are several discussions going on in the education sector, one of which is whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum or not. Some people believe that students should have the power to make these important decisions. Others argue that this can be a dangerous path and that a more structured approach is necessary. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument and give my opinion on the matter.

Firstly, many argue that education should be student-driven, which would allow students to tailor their high school curriculum according to their interests and specializations. Allowing students to have a say in the subjects they learn would provide them with the flexibility to explore their potential and pursue their passions, potentially making them more engaged and motivated in their schoolwork. This approach could help students in finding out their real interests and can make them more productive and self-sufficient in the future.

Moreover, the inclusion of student input into curriculum design and implementation would encourage critical thinking, citizenship, and leadership skills. As students participate in making decisions, they learn to think critically about the world and the role they want to play in it. This type of pedagogy will help students develop the skills necessary to be effective and thoughtful leaders in the future.

Furthermore, many students find the current curriculum to be too rigid, outdated, and not relevant to their lives and interests. Allowing students to curate the curriculum would help break down these barriers and introduce more relevant and up-to-date content to the curriculum, which could uplift student performance and test scores in the long run.

On the other hand, those who oppose the argument argue that allowing students to create their curriculum can lead to a lack of direction and academic rigor. They contend that such a lack of guidance could add to students' anxiety and confusion at a crucial time in their lives. Additionally, they claim that students may choose subjects that are not essential for their growth or may drop out of school entirely.

It is also necessary to question the ability of students to make informed decisions about their curriculum. Many students have limited information and understanding of the relevance of various subjects to their future careers. Consequently, a poorly-structured curriculum could negatively affect their admission to higher education institutions and their career opportunities.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their curriculum could open the door to biased selections and lead to the marginalization of specific subjects, disciplines, or perspectives. This would be detrimental to the education system's overarching goal of providing students with well-rounded knowledge and understanding. It is worth mentioning that a curriculum designed by a professional team is more likely to be academically rigorous and focused on providing the students with the appropriate knowledge and skills.

In conclusion, while there are advantages and disadvantages to allowing high school students to curate their curriculum, I believe that students should be given some degree of say in the education they receive. I believe that a good approach for any high school curriculum would be a blend of both student and educator input. This would combine student autonomy with professional guidance in a way that benefits every student. It will allow students to take ownership of their education, encourage creative thinking and foster intellectual curiosity, while educators ensure that the curriculum is academically rigorous and well-rounded.
