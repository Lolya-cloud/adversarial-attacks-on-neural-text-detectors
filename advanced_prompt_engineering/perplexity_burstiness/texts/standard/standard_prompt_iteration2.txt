Education is the central pillar upon which the future of any nation rests. The development of new ideas and technologies in the modern era has led to the changing needs of the workforce. Therefore, it is essential to have a curriculum that best prepares the students for the real world challenges. However, having a centralized system that decides what is taught to the students may hinder the development of necessary skills that are needed to excel in a particular field. Therefore, it is appropriate to allow high school students to curate their curriculum to best match their interests and ambitions.

The traditional curriculum in high school is often too rigid, offering minimal room for students to explore their interests fully. Students are often required to focus on specific subjects, and there is little flexibility to study subjects of their choice. Allowing students to curate their curriculum would give them the autonomy to explore their interests, which in turn would help develop a more profound passion for the subjects they are learning.

Furthermore, allowing students to choose their curriculum would also enable them to tailor their education to meet their future plans and goals. If students know that they want to follow a specific career path, they would have the flexibility to choose relevant subjects to fulfill their requirements. For instance, if a student desires to become a doctor, the student should have the opportunity to focus more on science and medicine subjects, orienting their curriculum to obtain a degree in science-based subjects. By doing so, it would be a more practical and realistic approach to learning rather than a one-size-fits-all curriculum.

Moreover, personalization of the curriculum helps promote a sense of importance and accountability among students. When students have a voice in the curriculum and are responsible for selecting their subjects and creating their schedule, they are more invested. Students would be more diligent in their studies because they have a choice in developing it and would therefore take ownership of their success.

Besides that, curating the curriculum would allow students to take subjects that interest them beyond what is taught in a typical classroom. For example, a student passionate about art or music should be allowed to develop their skills by choosing a related subject, rather than being limited to practical subjects like mathematics and science. Enabling students to choose a curriculum that resonates with them provides the opportunity to explore the subjects of their choice, encouraging their creativity, and potentially identifying a future career choice.

However, critics of the idea may argue that allowing students to curate their curriculum puts students at a disadvantage because the traditional curriculum is developed to provide foundational knowledge and skills to prepare for further education and future careers. While this may be true, a change in the curriculum could be introduced with reasonable limitations to ensure students continue to receive the necessary foundational knowledge. Furthermore, it would be an opportunity for students to learn how to make responsible decisions, develop effective time management skills, and learn how to research and choose courses that align with their future goals.

In conclusion, high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum to ensure the development of skills that align with their career interests and aspirations. The education curriculum should reflect the changing trends and future demands of the workforce. Personalizing the curriculum will allow students to develop a passion for learning, take ownership and responsibility for their learning, and help develop practical and realistic approaches to learning. Hence, the education system should prioritize the students' ability to drive their learning experiences by allowing them to curate their high school curriculum.
