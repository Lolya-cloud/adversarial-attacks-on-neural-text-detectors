Education is an integral aspect of human growth, and students' academic environment dictates their level of success. In the contemporary world, individuality and critical thinking are fast becoming a necessity. A few students aspire to take a different academic path, but the traditional academic system does not allow them that chance. Hence, the question of whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum arises.

Curated curriculum pertains to students selecting their learning material rather than a standardized curriculum enforced by the school system. The idea behind this concept is to empower students to pursue their passions and further improve their learning experience. However, the notion of personalized learning goes beyond following students' interests as it strives to create excited learners that are more like to excel in their classes and beyond.

Thus far, curation is almost non-existent in high schools, which raises the question of why it should exist. One of the primary reasons schools implement a fixed curriculum is to ensure that students achieve the necessary competencies within the established timelines. These competencies include assessments, knowledge acquisition, thinking and research skills among others. However, as an AI language model, I suppose we should understand that students are not robots and have different learning needs and abilities. Thus, some students, such as those gifted in some areas, may acquire the necessary competencies faster than others. Therefore, the idea of curation allows such students to delve deeper into their strengths instead of being held back and stifled. This, in turn, results in enthusiastic learners who are more likely to produce outstanding results.

Moreover, the concept of personalized curriculum also advances the idea of student-centered learning, whereby the selection of the necessary competencies relies on the student. Student-centered learning, as the name suggests, focuses on the student's learning style as the focal point of the educational process rather than the curriculum. Hence, curation can, therefore, provide an environment conducive to individualized learning, which would make high school more engrossing and relevant.

Furthermore, high school is the period when students look to find their career paths and future directions. Thus, the traditional curriculum may not be an accurate reflection of what a student may need in the future. Curation addresses this shortcoming by allowing students to choose courses and subject areas to explore their future aspirations actively. Students get to learn beyond the traditional system's constraints and form their goals, thereby making them more confident in their direction.

That said, society also has a say in what students should learn. Therefore, the idea of curation does not suggest that students design their learning paths entirely. Rather, it constitutes a partnership between the school and students. Schools would have to provide students with the guidance they require to progress as expected and achieve their set goals. Teachers would still identify the crucial elements of knowledge that students should acquire and ensure that the students maintain a given level of understanding.

In conclusion, personalized learning is slowly becoming a necessary component of the education system, and the idea of curation may further support its implementation. The concept is not disruptive to the standard practice of education but rather an enhancement that gives students the chance to explore their passion and strengths. With personalized learning, high school stands to become more engaging and relevant, thus producing exceptional and excited learners. Therefore, it is essential to consider giving students the chance to curate their curriculum to enhance their learning experience and prospects.
