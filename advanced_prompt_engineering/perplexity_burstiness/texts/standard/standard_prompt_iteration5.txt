The current education system is often criticized for being outdated and failing to provide students with the skills they need for the future. Many students feel that the curriculum is disinteresting, irrelevant, or simply not challenging. Given these criticisms, some argue that high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum to best suit their needs and interests.

Firstly, giving students the power to curate their high school curriculum would help increase their interest and motivation in learning. When students are given the freedom to choose topics they are passionate about, they are more likely to become engaged in the subject matter. This engagement can lead to greater success in learning and better academic outcomes overall.

Secondly, students would benefit from being able to customize their high school curriculum to prepare them better for their future. Many students have a clear idea of the career path they want to pursue after high school. Allowing these students to focus more in-depth on subjects such as coding or entrepreneurship could help them gain valuable skills to help them in their chosen field.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their own curriculum would give them a sense of autonomy and ownership of their education. Instead of forcing students into a one-size-fits-all program, schools can cater to individualized learning styles and preferences, providing a more personalized learning experience.

On the other hand, some critics of allowing students to curate their curriculum argue that not all students have the knowledge and experience to make the best decisions regarding their education. We may need to provide guidance to help students make the most informed decisions. For example, a student with little understanding of the science field may not be aware of the prerequisites needed for a biology course.

Moreover, there are practical considerations to allowing students to choose their own curriculum. High schools have specific requirements and standards that need to be met, so it may not be feasible to allow students to design their programs from scratch. However, openings can be created with minimum requirements on the core courses and general areas of study. This can still provide students with a sense of control and flexibility when it comes to designing their curriculum.

In conclusion, giving students the power to curate their high school curriculum can lead to greater engagement and customization of their education to better suit their needs. While the practicality and feasibility of such a move can be debated, the benefits of a more personalized education could help better prepare students for their academic and career future. Thus, education systems should seriously consider the benefits of customized curriculum and make efforts to make individualization a priority so that students can learn content tailored to their ability and interest.
