High school students: they are often characterized as aimless, apathetic, and just plain uninterested in what they're learning. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Many students are passionate about certain subjects, but are stuck taking classes they don't care about because they're required for graduation. So, the question becomes: should high school students be allowed to curate their own curriculum? 

Firstly, allowing students to choose their classes could increase engagement and motivation. When students are forced to take classes they have no interest in, they're less likely to be engaged and motivated, and therefore less likely to succeed. However, if they were given the chance to choose their classes, they would be more invested in what they're learning, leading to better performance and an overall greater appreciation for education. 

Furthermore, this would also allow students to explore their interests and passions. Many students have specific career goals, and allowing them to choose classes in those fields can give them a head start in achieving those goals. Additionally, high schools often don't offer classes in certain subjects, so allowing students to choose their own classes can give them a chance to study what they might not have otherwise. 

On the flip side, critics argue that students might miss out on important classes that are required for college and career success. However, this can be combated by allowing students to choose their classes, but still requiring them to take certain core classes. This way, students would still be exposed to variety of subjects, but they would also have some flexibility in what they're learning. 

Additionally, some worry that students might not have enough knowledge or guidance in choosing their own classes. However, high schools could implement programs and resources to help students navigate course selection, such as working with academic advisors or using online tools to help guide students. 

In conclusion, high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum. By giving students the freedom to choose their classes, we can increase engagement, motivation, and overall success in academics. Additionally, allowing students to explore their interests and passions can prepare them for future career success. Although there are valid concerns, they can be addressed by requiring students to take certain core classes and providing resources to guide them through course selection. Overall, it's time we start trusting our students and allowing them to have a say in their own education.
