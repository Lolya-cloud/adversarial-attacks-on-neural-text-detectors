The education system, an essential establishment that has been in existence for centuries, continues to be in the limelight. The system has faced enormous criticisms and debates over the years on what to include or exclude in the curriculum. The latest concern that has been clouding the education system globally is whether or not school students should have the liberty to curate their high school curriculum. While some arguments could be made for and against this proposal, this essay thoroughly delves into why students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. 

Foremost on the list as to why I believe that students should curate their own high school curriculum is that it would lead to a more personalized learning experience. The fact that each individual student is unique and possesses varying interests, passions, and future aspirations cannot be overemphasized. It is within this context that permitting students to participate in designing their curriculum would allow them to incorporate courses that align with their career goals and interests. Several institutions of higher learning already allow students to design their coursework, and this should be extended to high schools. Personalizing the learning experience of students is critical, and this approach could lead to better outcomes, for example, improved grades, higher retention rates, and enhanced critical thinking and problem solving skills.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable the education system to break free from the current monotony. The current education system is rigid and follows a one-size-fits-all approach to learning, which can be discouraging and uninspiring for students who want to learn more beyond the classroom. By integrating courses that fascinate them, students would be more invested and committed to their learning experiences, adding a unique dimension their learning experiences. This approach would indeed help students grow into responsible, self-assured adults with improved time management, and discipline.

However, challenges to this approach also exist. For instance, some argue that students lack the expertise to curate their curriculum effectively. This concern is not entirely unfounded, and it raises questions about the effectiveness of the education system. Some students may have different goals and interests that might not be in line with the government-approved educational standards. A possible way to tackle this issue would be to create committees responsible for ensuring the curriculum's quality and standards. This would ensure that the students' interests are balanced with the government's standards.

Despite the merits of the students curating their high school curriculum, there is a counterargument that they may lack the necessary experience required to make decisions that would prepare them for their future careers. However, this is a misconception that could be addressed. To this end, educators and career advisors can provide the background knowledge required to shape a student's career path while students collaborate with them to include curricular activities that are fundamental to their future career choices.

In conclusion, music, art, English, math, science, social studies, and foreign languages are essential components of the education system globally. However, allowing students to curate their high school curricula would introduce an added layer of personalization, creativity, and flexibility. This would lead to improved student development, a more engaging learning experience, and, ultimately, better career outcomes. Notwithstanding the existing concerns that could arise, such challenges could be addressed if schools are more collaborative with the curriculum design. The proposals and views expressed in this essay strongly support allowing students to curate their high school curricula.
