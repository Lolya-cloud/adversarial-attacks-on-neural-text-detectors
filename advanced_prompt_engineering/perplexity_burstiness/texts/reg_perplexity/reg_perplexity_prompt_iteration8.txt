Education is a significant factor in shaping our future. It provides the foundation upon which we build our knowledge and skills, paving the way to success. Among the crucial phases of academics is high school. With its focus on preparing students for the future, the curriculum plays an essential role in their development. However, with the advancements and opportunities of the modern age, students are increasingly becoming aware of their interests and passions. Given this, a question arises: "should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?" The answer to this question remains debatable, with pros and cons on both sides.

On the one hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would provide undeniable advantages. Flexibility, being a significant benefit, would afford students the opportunity to choose what they want to learn based on their passions and interests. Under the current system, students do not have much choice in their curriculum, thus leading to a lack of motivation to learn. Allowing students to select their courses would alter that. They could opt for more art subjects and fewer science subjects if they have an inclination towards art. This would ensure students are motivated, and progress would be more productive.

In addition to flexibility, another advantage of allowing students to curate their curriculum is that it would help them develop the skills needed for the future. It is not enough to follow a standard curriculum and expect students to have all the skills they would need to fit in a constantly evolving job market. Allowing students to pick courses relevant to their future careers would help them hone skills customised to their aspirations. This gives them a competitive edge in the job market. For instance, if a student wants to be a tech entrepreneur, they could take programming and business courses to learn to code and run a business simultaneously. This is beneficial not only to the student but to the economy as well.

On the other hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has some potential downsides. Firstly, not all students are aware of their passions and interests. Some students may not have explored enough to know what they want to learn. This way, students may end up making poor decisions regarding their curriculum, choosing courses for convenience or their friends' recommendations that would not benefit them in the long run. Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum might lead to a lack of standardization in grading. Different teachers have various teaching methods and grading policies, making it difficult to provide fair grading on a student's self-curated courses.

In conclusion, "should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?" remains a difficult question to answer. There are several pros and cons on either side of the argument. Flexibility and skill development are some of the benefits of allowing students to curate, while the potential for poor decision-making and lack of standardization are some of the drawbacks. It is crucial for students to obtain proper guidance from teachers and counselors before selecting courses. Hence, while I am in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, I believe it should come with conditions and guidelines to ensure that it benefits students and does not undermine their education.
