The topic of whether high school students should have the authority to curate their studies has sparked passionate debate among many scholars and educators. The central argument for permitting learners to take charge of their curriculum centers around the notion that it gives them a sense of ownership and control over their academic journey. Students, as they inch closer to graduation, ought to be imbued with a sense of responsibility for their educational path. Handing students some degree of control within their curriculum can result in an education customized to suit their interests, leading to increased motivation and engagement. Besides, learners learn best when the curriculum aligns with their interests and passions, thereby resulting in developing autonomy in decision-making.

Another argument that supports allowing students to design their curriculum is that it enables them to be more attuned to their educational needs. Students are a diverse group. They come from different backgrounds, cultures, and social environments, and no two students have the same academic goals or interests. As such, it becomes necessary to allow them to design their curriculum to meet their individual needs, which would result in better academic performance and increased learner satisfaction.

Despite these arguments, many critics argue that learners do not possess the expertise and knowledge to create a compelling curriculum. According to this line of thinking, students lack the foresight necessary to make sensible choices about what subject matters to be covered and why. It is suggested that learners are too young and lack academic maturity to understand which topics will benefit them in the long run.

Another argument against allowing learners to design their curriculum is that it could result in the devolution of academic standards. Critics suggest that educators have developed high school curriculums based on years of experience and feedback from learners. Permitting learners to design the curriculum could create flawed coursework that would ultimately result in an inferior quality of education in high schools. Critics claim that students may decide to concentrate on topics that are of interest to them, while ignoring classes that are classified as challenging or dull, particularly if the course demands hard work. Additionally, it brings into question whether all students have equal access to knowledge and materials on the subjects they desire to study.

To conclude, the issue of whether high school students should be allowed to curate their coursework is a polarizing one, with equally compelling arguments on both sides. However, choosing the right approach would balance these arguments to ensure that students receive the best education. To avoid the devolution of standards, students should pick topics that interest them, guided by an experienced team to help them make reasonable choices. This approach would ensure that students understand the educational value and relevance of each topic. As a result, instead of offering students complete autonomy over their coursework, schools should involve learners in creating a curriculum that caters to their needs and interests while ensuring that they receive a well-rounded education.
