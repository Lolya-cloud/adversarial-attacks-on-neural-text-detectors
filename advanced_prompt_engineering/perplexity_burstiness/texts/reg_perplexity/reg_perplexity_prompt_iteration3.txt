The current high school system has remained unchanged for several years, with students adhering to a predetermined curriculum that has been designed and approved by experts in the educational field. Nonetheless, the consideration of whether high school students should be given the freedom to personalize their curriculum has sparked debates. Although there are various factors to consider regarding state requirements and educational standards, from my perspective, high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum.

Primarily, one of the myriad of advantages of allowing students to tailor their curriculum is that it empowers them to take charge of their learning process. Consequently, students are more engrossed in their learning process as they study subjects that they find interesting and tied to their personal goals. The increased engagement also leads to a higher probability of them being more dedicated to achieving academic excellence. This, in turn, leads to better performance outcomes and future career success.

Furthermore, a reason why students should be given the freedom to curate their high school curriculum is the improvement of their mental well-being and emotional health. High school students experience a diverse range of challenges, including academic pressure, social expectations, and personal challenges. The opportunity to curate their curriculum provides a sense of control and autonomy that translates to reduced anxiety and stress levels.

Likewise, curating their curriculum provides an opportunity for students to develop valuable life skills, including decision-making, problem-solving, and critical thinking. By being part of the decision-making process concerning what subjects they study, students have to undertake research and, importantly, weigh their options, culminating in the identification of subjects that align with their educational goals and personal interests.

Moreover, student-led curriculums provide more flexibility and options, allowing them to find relevance in their courses of study. Consequently, students can develop their skills and leverage their potential as they chart their future academic or career paths.

However, there are potential pitfalls of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. One potential disadvantage is that students may learn less efficiently, thereby compromising the quality of their education. Proponents of this argument claim that students may only decide to study subjects that appeal to them and ignore critical topics, leading to an unbalanced education system.

Moreover, students may prioritize electives over essential subjects in the curriculum, taking easier options that demand less time and effort. Schools must, therefore, ensure that students first undertake essential subjects before allowing them to personalize their curriculum.

In summary, it is essential to offer high school students a degree of autonomy in shaping their course of study to provide relevancy and aligned objectives with their academic, personal, and career goals. While there are potential downsides towards this approach, such as unyielding students or an unbalanced education system, these pitfalls can be mitigated by schools offering a rigorous, challenging curriculum to ensure students receive a holistic education, preparing them for their future studies and careers. By creating an environment that fosters student engagement through flexible curricula, schools will be able to provide their students with the opportunity for comprehensive growth and development.
