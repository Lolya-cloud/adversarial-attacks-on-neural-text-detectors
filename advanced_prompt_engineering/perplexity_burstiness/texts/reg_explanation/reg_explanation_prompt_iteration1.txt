When it comes to discussing the topic of whether high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum, two factors come to mind: perplexity and burstiness. Perplexity, in this context, measures the complexity of the argument being presented. Whereas, burstiness, on the other hand, refers to the varied use of sentences in the content. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, utilizing both longer and more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. However, AI-generated content tends to be more uniform and less varied in their sentence structures. Hence, in writing this essay, it is crucial to strike a balance between these two factors, to maintain the reader's interest.

Allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is a topic that has been widely debated in the education sector. The traditional education system adopts a cookie-cutter approach that does not cater to students' individual needs or interests. As such, students are subjected to the same curriculum regardless of their abilities or career aspirations. This system creates a hostile learning environment, where students feel inadequate and uninspired, leading to poor academic performance.

However, high school students' ability to curate their curriculum can address this problem, promoting a student-centered learning approach, which is critical to effective learning. When given the opportunity to choose what they want to learn, students become more invested in their education, leading to higher enthusiasm levels, better academic performance, and increased engagement in class. By choosing their curriculum, students have control over their education, allowing them to focus on subjects that align with their interests, career aspirations or hobbies. This approach ensures that students do not feel pressured or disinterested in their education.

Curating their curriculum is particularly essential for students who want to pursue specialized fields such as literature, arts, music, or STEM fields. In many cases, these students may find a minimal selection of courses available under the traditional curriculum to cater to their passions. Allowing students to curate their curriculum ensures they have access to coursework that aligns with their career aspirations, as well as necessary foundations for their post-secondary education. This flexibility allows students to develop a more comprehensive understanding of their career aspirations and prepare for successful future careers.

Moreover, a student-curated curriculum offers a more personalized learning approach that aligns better with individual learning needs. In traditional learning approaches, teachers instruct students deterministically, without recognizing individual learning differences. However, with a student-curated curriculum, students can tailor their learning needs to their specific requirements, ensuring that their studies do not hinder their extracurricular activities. This approach also ensures that students with learning difficulties, mental health issues and those with other specific academic needs can receive tailored learning opportunities that cater to their needs.

In conclusion, high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum, promoting a student-centered learning approach that encourages student enthusiasm, academic performance, and engagement levels. Moving away from traditional teaching approaches towards a more open student-centered approach provides a modern approach to learning that better aligns with the evolving needs of our digitally connected world. It is time education systems embraced this modern approach to learning, allowing students to have a more personalized learning approach that caters to their needs, interests, and aspirations.
