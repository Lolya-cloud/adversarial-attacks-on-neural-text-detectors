As I set out to write this essay, I am mindful of two critical factors that underpin effective communication: perplexity and burstiness. Perplexity pertains to the intricacy of the text and gauges its complexity, while burstiness measures the variation in sentence length and complexity. Traditionally, when people write, they tend to inject greater burstiness in their writing by incorporating longer and more complex sentences, alternating them with shorter ones. Conversely, AI-generated sentences tend to be more consistent in terms of structure and length. With this in mind, I aim to strike a balance between the two by crafting an essay with ample perplexity and burstiness.

For many high school students, the experience of trudging through a predetermined curriculum can feel arduous and disconnected from their interests or future aspirations. Recent years have seen an increase in the clamor for students to curate their own high school curriculum, giving them greater control over the courses they take and the skills they develop. On this matter, there are compelling arguments on both sides. Nonetheless, I am of the belief that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is undeniably beneficial.

One of the primary arguments in favor of student-led curation lies in its potential to enhance engagement and motivation. When students have a say in what they learn, they are more likely to feel invested and take an active role in their learning. For students who struggle with conventional academic subjects but have a knack for other areas, like music or technology, curating their own curriculum can help them focus on their interests and stay engaged in school.

In addition, letting students curate their own curriculum can better prepare them for the realities of the modern world. In a rapidly changing job market, it is imperative that individuals possess a broad set of skills and can adapt to new demands quickly. Curating their own curriculum helps students develop this adaptability and gain a diverse skill set that meets the demands of current employment trends. Furthermore, it can foster the development of valuable skills like goal-setting, effective time management, and self-accountability.

However, some are skeptical of student-led curation, citing concerns that students may lack the knowledge or experience necessary for making informed decisions. It is true that students require guidance in making these choices, but working together with teachers, counselors, and other experts can equip students with the tools and knowledge they need to make wise decisions. Setting particular requirements for students to fulfill, such as taking a particular number of classes in specific subjects or maintaining specific performance benchmarks, can mitigate this concern.

Similarly, there are concerns that student-led curation could exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, students from more affluent backgrounds may have access to more resources and advanced coursework opportunities than those from less privileged backgrounds. Addressing this concern requires ensuring that all students have access to the same resources and opportunities, so they all get a chance to explore their interests fully.

In conclusion, despite some valid concerns, the benefits of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum outweigh the risks. By veering away from a standardized approach to education and providing students with the ability to tailor their coursework to their interests, we can boost engagement, motivation and prepare them adequately for their future. Through the right measures to guide, equip, and provide resources, all students can benefit from a system that equips them with the skills necessary to navigate the fast-changing world around them.
