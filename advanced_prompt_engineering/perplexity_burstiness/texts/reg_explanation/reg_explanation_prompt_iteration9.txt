When it comes to the question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum, two factors are crucial: perplexity and burstiness. Perplexity measures the complexity of the arguments and ideas presented in the text. Burstiness, on the other hand, compares the variations of sentences - that is, how much variation there is between longer and more complex sentences versus shorter, simpler ones.

Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, incorporating a mix of sentence lengths and complexities to give their text a more dynamic and engaging feel. For instance, an essay arguing for or against allowing students to curate their high school curriculum might contain longer, more complex sentences to explore the nuances of the debate, as well as simpler sentences to provide context and support the main points. In this way, human writers seek to keep their readers engaged by creating a sense of rhythm and flow in their text.

However, AI-generated content tends to be less bursty by default. Because AI-generated text relies on algorithms to produce sentences and phrases based on patterns in existing text, it can be more uniform and formulaic. While this can be useful in some contexts - such as generating weather forecasts or stock reports - it can make AI-generated text feel less engaging and humanlike. In the context of a topic like school curriculum, where nuance and context are important, this lack of burstiness could be a significant drawback.

Therefore, when writing an essay about whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum, it is important to balance perplexity and burstiness. To achieve this, human writers can draw on a range of writing techniques, such as varying sentence length and structure, incorporating anecdotes or examples, and using rhetorical devices like analogies and metaphors. These techniques can help to keep readers engaged by creating a sense of flow and momentum in the text while also exploring the complex nuances of the topic at hand.

In the essay above, the writer has achieved a good balance of perplexity and burstiness by exploring both the benefits and drawbacks of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. The writer uses longer, more complex sentences to delve into the nuances of the debate, such as the potential knowledge gaps that could arise if students choose courses that are not academically challenging or relevant. At the same time, the writer incorporates simpler sentences to provide context and support for the main points, such as the fact that traditional high school curriculums can be too rigid and limiting for many students.

Overall, when it comes to writing about complex topics like school curriculum, it is essential to balance perplexity and burstiness. By doing so, writers can create text that is engaging, informative, and thought-provoking, even on challenging or contentious topics.
