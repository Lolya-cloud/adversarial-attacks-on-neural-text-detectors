The current high school curriculum is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of academic subjects such as science, math, social studies, and English. However, with the current high school curriculum being rigidly designed and structured, many students find themselves disinterested and unmotivated, ultimately leading to a lack of engagement and poor academic performance. Furthermore, this one-size-fits-all curriculum may not be able to meet the individual needs and interests of each student. Therefore, the question arises, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? 

The answer to this question is highly debatable, with some educators and stakeholders arguing in favor of a student-designed curriculum while others stand firm against it. Those that are for allowing students to curate their high school curriculum believe that it would address the aforementioned issues of disinterest and detachment. It gives the students the opportunity to study subjects that they feel passionate about and to pursue academic goals that are relevant to their interests and career aspirations. Essentially, student-curated high school curricula will allow students to personalize their educational experience, ultimately leading to greater interest and engagement, yielding better academic performance.

However, this radical change to the current high school curriculum comes with its own set of challenges. Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may impact the teaching resources available. Teachers and schools may need to allocate more resources to this program which could detract from existing programs. Secondly, there is the question of how to objectively assess the success of the curriculum when students are designing their learning path. 

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could also lead to a decrease in social mobility. Students from families that have backgrounds in academia, that can afford tutoring or who have had access to additional resources will have an advantage when curating their high school curriculum. These students would be able to choose a more particular subject or significant aspect of one subject, leading to a greater opportunity for understanding in the subject. Whereas students with little academic support may not understand that the simpler approach to education is perhaps the best.

Furthermore, it is important to consider the emotional and personal effects on students when allowing them to design their curriculum. Implementing a student-curated high school curriculum may lead to undue pressure and stress amongst some students, especially those who struggle with academic decision-making, and even more so during a pandemic crisis, where mental health is already a significant issue. Therefore, we must consider that we are asking any student that seeks to curate their high school curriculum to take on additional responsibility.

In conclusion, while the concept of student-curated curriculum echos the trend towards personalized learning experiences, mainly as seen in higher education, high school level may not be the best time to apply this concept on students. However, efforts towards broadening the curriculum and offering more choices should continue. The right blend of structure and freedom would be ideal to achieve the best academic result. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize the importance of student agency and input in the curriculum, while also ensuring an objective assessment of student achievements. Ultimately, we should prioritize students, and any reform in the curriculum should aim to make it more student-centric, keeping in mind issues related to equality, availability of resources, and accessibility.
