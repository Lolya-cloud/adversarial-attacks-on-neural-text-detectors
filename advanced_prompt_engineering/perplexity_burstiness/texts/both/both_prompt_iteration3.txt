The question of whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is a contentious issue that has been the subject of heated debates in academic circles. While some educators and parents argue that allowing students to choose their own courses and subjects can lead to a more personalized educational experience, others contend that it may undermine the quality and coherence of the curriculum. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and explore the perplexities and complexities that arise from this issue.

On the one hand, proponents of student-curated curricula argue that it provides students with greater agency and autonomy over their educational journey. By allowing them to select their own courses and subjects, students can tailor their education to their personal interests, goals, and strengths. This can help motivate and engage students, as they have a greater sense of ownership and investment in their learning. Moreover, they argue that this approach can help develop important skills such as critical thinking, decision-making, and self-direction, which are essential for success in college and beyond.

However, opponents of student-curated curricula argue that it can have negative consequences for learning outcomes. Specifically, they argue that it may create a fragmented and incoherent curriculum, where students are only exposed to topics that they are already familiar with or have an existing interest in. This can limit their exposure to new and diverse perspectives, thereby stifling intellectual curiosity and growth. Furthermore, they contend that students may not have the necessary expertise or knowledge to make informed decisions about their educational trajectory, leading them to make decisions that may not be in their best interest in the long run.

Another perplexing aspect of this issue is the potential impact on equity and access. One concern is that students from privileged backgrounds may be better equipped to navigate a system where they have more decision-making power, leading to further inequities in access to resources and opportunities. Additionally, some educators worry that certain courses or subjects may become more popular than others, leading to overcrowding and resource allocation issues. This could further disadvantage students who may not have access to the courses they need to pursue their interests or academic goals.

On the other hand, there are ways to address these potential risks and challenges. For example, schools could offer guidance and support to students as they curate their own curriculum, providing them with information on various courses and subjects and helping them make informed decisions. Additionally, schools could establish guidelines or requirements to ensure that students receive a well-rounded and comprehensive education. For instance, they could require students to take a certain number of courses in a range of subjects, or to take core courses that are essential for college preparedness.

Ultimately, the question of whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is a complex and multifaceted issue. While there are undoubtedly risks and challenges that need to be addressed, there are also potential benefits that should not be overlooked. By providing students with greater agency and autonomy over their education, we may be better able to engage and motivate them, while also promoting the development of important skills. However, it is essential that schools and educators work to ensure that a student-curated curriculum is structured and comprehensive, and that it continues to promote equity and access for all students.
