The notion of a standardized curriculum, designed by authorities and adopted broadly by schools, has been fundamentally central to the modern educational system for the past century. However, with the advent of a more student-centered approach to learning, there has been significant debate on whether high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum. The idea is that students could choose the subjects and topics they study based on their personal interests and passions. On one hand, some people argue that allowing such flexibility would offer students the freedom to delve into what interests them most, potentially increasing their intellectual curiosity and motivation to learn. On the other hand, some argue that high school students might choose classes and topics based on their personal preferences, unconcerned with the skills and knowledge required to succeed in college, career, and life. Therefore, the question arises: should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

One of the primary reasons why some education experts and policymakers advocate for students to have the ability to customize their high school curriculum is that it could foster a deep interest in learning. Students who are interested in a subject are more likely to engage with the material, participate in class discussions, produce quality work, and develop a more nuanced understanding of topics. By allowing students to curate their own curriculum, educators may kindle a sense of intellectual curiosity in students that goes beyond the classroom, which may be the key to lifelong learning. This approach could give students an opportunity to develop transferable skills that they will need in college, career, and life.

Furthermore, students who are intrinsically motivated are often the most engaged and active learners, leading to improved academic performance. They are more likely to take ownership of their educational journey, which typically results in improved confidence, self-efficacy, and personal development.

On the other hand, some people argue that it is dangerous to allow high school students to curate their own curriculum without proper guidance. Some contend that students may be tempted to select classes and topics that are easy to complete, rather than challenging themselves academically. This could result in lower academic standards, which could affect the quality of education that students receive, and result in deficient skills and knowledge in certain areas. Moreover, students may not be exposed to different subjects that they may not have known existed, which could limit their intellectual horizons. 

Additionally, allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum could have unintended consequences, particularly for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Some argue that students from these backgrounds may not have access to the same resources to discover new subjects and may be at a disadvantage, compared to their more privileged peers, who are in a better position to explore a broader range of classes and topics.

In conclusion, the issue of whether high school students should have the ability to curate their own curriculum is both complex and multifaceted. While there are certainly advantages to this approach, there are also significant risks and challenges to consider. Ultimately, the decision needs to be grounded in an understanding of the cultural, economic, and educational context of the school system in question. Nevertheless, it is clear that high school students who are intrinsically motivated by their educational interests are likely to be the most successful and poised to achieve their future goals. Therefore, it is essential to find a balance between providing students with a framework of core subjects and allowing them the freedom to explore subjects that ignite their imagination and curiosity.
