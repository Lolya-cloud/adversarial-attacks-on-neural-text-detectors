There is a lot of buzz around school students having the ability to curate their high school curriculum. Some believe that it will encourage students to take more ownership of their education, while others think it might lead to students avoiding essential subjects. It is a conversation that cuts to the core of what public education represents, whether schools should solely focus on educating for future careers or also to foster curiosity, learning, and growth in the present.

The first point to consider on whether school students should curate their high school curriculum is the fact that students tend to have different interests and capability levels when it comes to academic subjects. By ranging the curriculum to fit individual students' interests, schools may be able to motivate students more and ultimately increase their learning outcome. Students who are fascinated with science can take more science classes, while students who love literature may have the possibility to read and learn more in that field. However, it is important to ensure that students are not skipping foundational courses that provide the basic knowledge and skills they need to succeed academically. Thus, schools should ensure that students cover essential and necessary subjects while retaining the room for students to follow their inclination of study.

A second point to consider is that students, especially in high school, are still in the stage of finding and identifying their interests and talents. It is plausible that offering students more freedom to build their curriculum will provide them with ample opportunity to cultivate their talent. It will offer them a chance to follow their passion, and in doing so, they may be able to discover their calling earlier in life. If a student is considering a particular field, being able to take classes in it during high school without pressure can help them decide whether or not it is the path they want to pursue in life.

However, the ability to curate their high school curriculum could also result in the chance that students may not get exposed to subjects they may otherwise benefit from. Students may tend to lean toward subject matters that they already know they enjoy but fail to discover new areas that they would have an interest in by following a traditional and complete curriculum. The notion of removing the complete array of subjects could hinder students' opportunities to explore and discover new interests. Therefore, the final decision on the curriculum content should be taken after considering the benefits of both traditional complete curriculum and optimized student-curated curriculum.

Moreover, school teachers and administrative bodies should work towards creating a system that carefully balances both the national standards with the flexibility to curate an educational programme. This hybrid system of education provision should allow students to customize their learning path while maintaining the fundamental topics and ensure that they are quality topics. As a result, it would appear to offer the greatest benefits of both worlds.

In conclusion, the idea of school students curating their high school curriculum presents itself with several pros and cons. It has the possibility of encouraging a love for learning considerably, sparking new interests, and cultivating new skills that otherwise might not have been discovered. Simultaneously, it may have unfavourable, long-lasting consequences and could lead to avoidance of fundamental classes needed to provide a comprehensive education. Therefore, schools should carefully consider the benefits of both traditional and student-curated curriculum before making their final decision. The goal should be to implement a hybrid system that offers opportunities for customization while ensuring that students attain the core knowledge needed to succeed in their future endeavors.
