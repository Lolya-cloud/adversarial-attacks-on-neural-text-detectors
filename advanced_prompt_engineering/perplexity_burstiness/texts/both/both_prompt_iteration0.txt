The question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is one that has sparked intense debate and discussion in recent years. Some argue that allowing students to have more control over the content and structure of their learning experience will increase engagement and motivation, while others believe that it could lead to a lack of academic rigor and a focus on easy, enjoyable subjects over challenging ones.

One argument in favor of curating the high school curriculum is that it would allow students to tailor their education to their particular interests and passions. This could increase motivation and engagement, as students would be more invested in the content they were learning. Additionally, allowing students to choose their own courses could provide them with valuable skills and experiences that they would not have gained otherwise. For example, a student who is interested in film could use their elective courses to develop skills in video editing, scriptwriting, and film production. This experience could be very beneficial if they decide to pursue a career in the film industry.

On the other hand, there are concerns that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to a lack of academic rigor. Some students might choose to take only the easiest courses, rather than challenging themselves with difficult subjects. This could lead to a lack of preparation for college or the workforce, where a good education is essential. This argument is particularly relevant for students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, as they may not have access to the same resources and opportunities as their wealthier peers. Allowing these students to curate their own curriculum could exacerbate existing educational inequalities and further disadvantage them in the future.

Another potential issue with student-curated curriculums is that students may not have the necessary knowledge and experience to make informed decisions about their education. High school students are still in the process of developing their critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills, and may not fully understand the implications of their choices. For example, a student might prioritize taking courses that are fun and easy over those that are challenging but necessary for their future career goals. Without guidance from experienced adults, students may not be able to make the best choices for their long-term success.

Despite these concerns, there are some ways that high schools could incorporate student choice into the curriculum in a productive way. For example, schools could offer a range of elective courses that students could choose from based on their interests and goals. Additionally, schools could give students some input into the types of assignments and projects they complete within a certain course, without giving them complete control over the content. This would allow for greater student agency and engagement, while still ensuring that students are being challenged and prepared for their future endeavors.

In conclusion, the question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is a complex one that requires careful consideration. While there are certainly benefits to allowing students to have more control over their education, there are also potential drawbacks. It is essential that schools strike a balance between providing students with the freedom to explore their interests and ensuring that they receive a rigorous and well-rounded education that will prepare them for success in the future.
