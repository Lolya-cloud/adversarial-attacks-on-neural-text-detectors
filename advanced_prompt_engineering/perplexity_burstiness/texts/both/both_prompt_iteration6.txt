Education is supposed to provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge to prepare them for a successful future. However, the traditional approach of delivering a standardized curriculum to students has come under scrutiny in recent times. Students are different, and their educational goals should reflect that. The idea of allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum has gained popularity in recent years. The question remains, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

One argument in favour of student-curated high school curriculum is that it allows students to tailor their education to their specific needs. Students have varying interests and strengths, and a one-size-fits-all curriculum may not foster their individual growth optimally. Allowing students to curate their curriculum will enable them to focus on areas of their interest and build upon their natural talents. This approach can positively impact students' engagement, grades, and overall academic success. Furthermore, young people need to develop specific competencies and skills for their future careers. By having the power to select courses related to their career choice, students will have a more constructive and productive time in school.

On the other hand, some people feel that allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum may be disruptive and not provide enough rigour. High school is supposed to be a rigorous academic experience where students gain knowledge that will help them succeed in college or university. Students may not realise the importance of certain courses and fail to choose them. Furthermore, some young people may not possess the necessary discipline and foresight to make informed decisions about their education. They need the guidance of experts. If students misalign with their curriculum choices, it can harm their personal growth and severely limit future career opportunities.

Another advantage of students selecting their own high school curriculum is it can help them develop meaningful life skills. Having autonomy over their academic choices will help young people learn how to make decisions that align with their values and potential. It may also teach them the importance of time-management, delegation, and critical thinking. Such skills are valuable beyond academic settings, and enabling young people to cultivate them helps to build well-rounded individuals capable of being successful in life.

Finally, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum promotes a sense of responsibility and accountability. When young people have a say in their education, they are more likely to invest their energy and time into it. Since the stakes are higher, they will feel more compelled to put in more effort and work harder to achieve their desired outcome. This will translate to future success in academics and beyond.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has various advantages and disadvantages, and the decision to adopt the practice requires a thoughtful and informed discussion. While it may seem unconventional, personalized education can foster creativity, motivation, and genuine interest in learning. By empowering young people to take ownership of their education, it’s likely that learners will become more engaged and enthusiastic about learning, preparing them better for their future endeavours. However, it’s important to ensure that students receive guidance and input from experts to ensure they make informed choices. Personalization should be a viable option for students, but not at the expense of the rigour and structure that’s necessary to ensure academic success.
