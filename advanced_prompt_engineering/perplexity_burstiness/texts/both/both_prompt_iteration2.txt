The question of whether high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum is a matter of great debate. While some argue that students should have the freedom to tailor their education to their own unique interests and strengths, others claim that such a system would be too chaotic and would lead to a lack of foundational knowledge necessary for future success.

On the one hand, allowing students to choose their own courses could be seen as a way to encourage personalization and engagement within the education system. By allowing students to choose the subjects that they find most interesting and relevant, they are more likely to be engaged in their studies and motivated to succeed. Additionally, this approach recognizes the reality that not all students learn in the same way, and that different students may have different strengths and areas of interest.

Moreover, students who have more control over their education, are more likely to develop a stronger sense of ownership over their own learning. Rather than feeling that their education is something that is being done to them, students may be more likely to see themselves as active participants in the process, taking on greater responsibility for their own educational journey.

However, such an approach is not without its challenges. One of the primary arguments against allowing students to curate their own education is that it would lead to inadequate preparation for the challenges of tertiary education and the workforce. Without a solid foundation in key subjects like math, science, and history, students may struggle to meet the rigorous academic demands of higher education and the real world.

Furthermore, allowing students to choose their own subjects may also result in a significant degree of inequality. Students from more affluent backgrounds may have more opportunities to take advanced classes or pursue specialized interests outside of school, while disenfranchised students could end up with a less diverse and less impactful high school curriculum.

While there is no easy answer to this complex question, a balanced approach may be the key. One possible solution could be to allow students a certain degree of choice in subjects to take within each core subject area. For instance, students could choose among various math courses that are aligned with the curriculum requirements, or choose from a list of history, science or literature electives. This would provide some room for personalization while still ensuring that students receive a well-rounded education.

It should also be recognized that the issue of curriculum curation is not solely the responsibility of students or parents. Teachers and administrators also should have a role in shaping the educational experience of students. A teacher's in-depth knowledge of different subject areas, as well as their ability to build rapport with students, can also inform the curriculum. Administrators can bring in new technologies, offer additional resources, and create alternative pathways to learning that will benefit everyone.

In the end, the question of whether students should have more control over their high school education is a difficult one. While some may be skeptical of the idea, others suggest that it could be beneficial in promoting personalization and motivation in students. Nevertheless, a balanced approach that incorporates input from all stakeholders is probably the best way forward. By working together, we can ensure that students receive the education they need and are empowered to reach their full potential.
