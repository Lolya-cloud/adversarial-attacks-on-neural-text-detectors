As the education system continues to evolve and adapt to the changing world, there has been a growing debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Some argue that this would give students more autonomy and flexibility, while others believe that it could lead to a lack of necessary academic rigor and diversity.

Those in favor of allowing students to curate their own curriculum argue that it would enable them to pursue their individual interests and passions, leading to a more engaged and motivated learning experience. Students would be able to tailor their courses to suit their career aspirations, strengths, or weaknesses, leading to academic success. They could also take courses at an accelerated pace, graduating high school sooner and advancing their education faster.

Additionally, students could be more inclusive in creating the curriculum, meaning that they would get involved in developing courses that are unique to their school. This has the potential to expand subject matter and make the high school experience more rigorous and fulfilling. It can bring increased creativity in educational planning, as it gives students the opportunity to learn about and explore the world around them on their terms.

However, several potentially problematic aspects arise from this proposal, including the lack of standardization in education, creating an uneven playing field for students from different backgrounds and schools. It can lead to schools with weaker curricula or unstandardized practices being left behind. 

Moreover, student-led curriculum design may lead to a further erosion of the quality of teachers. If students are choosing their own courses, there may be less reason for teachers to be experienced in specific subject matters. 

Moreover, there is a risk that students will overlook important core subjects that are necessary for academic and professional success. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing an engineering degree may opt out of taking English classes on the belief that they will not need it. This can be harmful to their learning experience and also can result in a narrow mindset for students, who do not explore other areas of their academic potential.

Proponents of this idea argue that students can be monitored, and academic advisors and faculty mentors can provide guidance on course selection to minimize the negative effects of limited knowledge. Additionally, it would be possible to ensure that students complete essential courses as required, while also giving them a degree of flexibility. However, some educators remain concerned about the implications such policies could have.

Another criticism of the proposal is the expense. While it may lead to cutting certain courses or inefficiencies to increase funding, the cost of educating students in a student-selected curriculum may be higher than an administration-selected one. Increases in expenses, as well as a lack of appropriate funding, could even lead to public schools that host communities with lower income and fewer resources feeling left out of this innovative process.

In conclusion, while the notion of students being able to create their high school curriculum sounds appealing in its capacity to cater to individual interests, needs and desires, the idea does present some potential risks and challenges. The quality of education, availability of sufficient resources, administrational standardization, and differences in student backgrounds all need to be considered before allowing students to curate their curriculum. However, if implemented effectively and in a manner that benefits from expert academic counseling, the proposal should be given adequate consideration, since student-led curriculum development presents the potential to help prepare high school students for a diverse, successful, and fulfilling future.
