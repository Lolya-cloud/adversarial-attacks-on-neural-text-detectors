The process of curating a high school curriculum is a complex and important one, with various stakeholders involved in making decisions that can have a significant impact on students' academic and personal growth. The question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum is a perplexing one that raises many difficult questions about the role of education, the authority of educators, and the rights of young people.

One argument in favor of allowing students to curate their own curriculum is that it would give them more autonomy and agency over their own learning. By allowing students to choose the courses and topics that interest them, they would be more engaged and invested in their education, and would be more likely to pursue their passions and develop their unique talents. This approach would also promote a more personalized approach to education, which is increasingly recognized as an important element of effective teaching practices.

However, there are also a number of concerns that arise when considering this approach. One of the most significant is the issue of students choosing courses that are not academically rigorous or that do not align with the broader goals of education. Without proper guidance and oversight, students may be tempted to choose courses that are easy or that appeal to their personal interests but do not provide the foundations for future success. Additionally, some may argue that allowing students to curate their own curriculum could perpetuate inequalities and limit opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may have less access to information and resources to make informed and effective choices.

Another consideration is the role of educators in the educational process. Some argue that education is a profession that requires specialized knowledge and training, and that educators are uniquely qualified to make decisions about what courses and topics are most valuable and appropriate for students to study. By allowing students to curate their own curriculum, there is a risk that educators will lose their authority and expertise, resulting in a lack of coherence and consistency across the school system.

However, this argument overlooks the fact that educators can still play a critical role in guiding and supporting students as they curate their own curriculum. By providing students with information and resources about their options, educators can help students make informed decisions that align with their interests and aspirations while still meeting the standards of a rigorous and comprehensive education. Furthermore, by involving students in the process of curriculum development, educators can foster a more collaborative, student-centered approach to learning that promotes inquiry, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

Ultimately, the question of whether school students should be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum is a complex and multifaceted one that requires careful consideration and debate. While there are certainly risks and concerns associated with this approach, there is also significant potential for promoting student engagement, personalization, and a more democratic approach to education. As such, it is critical that we continue to explore and evaluate the benefits and potential drawbacks of this approach, engaging stakeholders at all levels of the education system to arrive at a more informed and inclusive decision.
