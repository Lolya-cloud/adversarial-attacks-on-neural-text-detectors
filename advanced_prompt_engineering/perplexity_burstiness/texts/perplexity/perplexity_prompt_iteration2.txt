The high school curriculum is undoubtedly one of the essential things that shape the future of students. While traditionally, curriculums were designed and implemented by the school authorities, this approach has been brought under the spotlight in recent times. One new idea that has emerged is to involve students in the process of curating their high school curriculum. This, however, is not a straightforward decision. The perplexity of the matter is not only because there are pros and cons to it, but it also impacts the future of students which makes it difficult to make a definitive decision. This essay seeks to explore the question, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

One of the primary reasons why students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculums is that they are the ones who occupy the classroom. Young people are more familiar with the dynamics and interests of students than their parents or school authorities. As such, involving them in the process not only facilitates the acquisition of new knowledge but also increases their sense of ownership in their education. A survey conducted by the Independent Schools Association indicated that schools with student-led curriculums saw an improvement in student engagement and academic performance. For example, students who are allowed to choose their course materials are more likely to study because they enjoy them, and their interest was piqued at the beginning of the process.

On the other hand, allowing students to choose their high school curriculum could lead to the proliferation of disjointed educational practices. When the curriculum development process is consistently supervised by educators and policymakers, the continuity of the coursework is assured. In contrast, allowing students to pick and choose courses independently could lead to an imbalance between subject areas, leaving broad gaps in student knowledge. Another potential issue is that students could pick subjects based solely on their interest without considering the applicability of those courses to their future careers. In this circumstance, they may miss critical foundational knowledge in other areas which could have a long-lasting impact on their future.

Furthermore, it is vital to note that the process of curriculum curation is very complex, and decision-making should be made with careful considerations of various factors. As such, student input should be significant but done in collaboration with educational professionals. Involving teachers and school authorities with experience in curriculum development ensures that students have a well-rounded educational career that is informed by both student interest and long-term goals. Students should also have the option of independent course selection; however, it should be done in consultation with experienced counselors to ensure that it fits with their overall educational goals.

In conclusion, high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculums, but with caveats. The advantages are compelling and providing student choice in their courses should boost their engagement with the learning process. However, there are potential pitfalls to consider as well. While the traditional approach to curriculum development has worked well, it is essential to equally acknowledge student input. The future is, after all, in their hands. Therefore, it is critical that the process should be collaborative, and careful consideration should be taken when it comes to students choosing their courses lest they miss out on something vital that could impact their future aspirations.
