The idea of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum is a contentious one. Some believe that it would give students more freedom to explore their academic interests and talents, whilst others believe that it could lead to a lack of consistency in education. 

On one hand, allowing students to design their own high school curriculum would provide an opportunity for individualized learning. Students can select courses they are passionate about and feel more motivated to engage with. For instance, a student interested in anthropology could choose related courses, whilst another student who loves programming could select computer science courses. Such customization would enable students to pursue their interests to the fullest, enhancing their academic skills and knowledge. The freedom to design their education according to their needs would offer educational flexibility, allowing students to progress at their own pace.

However, on the other hand, allowing students this autonomy in their education could lead to inconsistency in their education. Students may prioritize courses they like, rather than courses they need. For example, a student might overlook a critical subject like mathematics, which can be detrimental in achieving a diverse and well-rounded education. From a broader perspective, this lack of consistency could lead to a distinction in academic standards between schools and students, creating selected pockets of knowledge. It could also potentially hold detrimental effects in the long run, as students might struggle with limited knowledge in irrelevant subjects.

Another challenge is the lack of guidance. Bloom's Taxonomy highlights that before students can meaningfully apply knowledge, they must understand it. Without proper guidance and support, students might choose a schedule that is overly ambitious, stretch their intellectual limits or select courses that do not suit their skillsets. Without intervention, students might not have learned enough to advance their proficiency in a subject, leaving them vulnerable for future endeavors.

Furthermore, there may also be inequities resulting from how students choose their curriculum. Students who have access to more resources or information about certain courses may be at an advantage over others who do not. This could effectively mean that certain academic paths are less accessible, further widening the already-existing achievement gap. 

Despite these challenges, the idea of allowing students to customize their high school curriculum can be achieved through a collaborative approach. Students, teachers, and parents can work collaboratively to identify courses that the student is interested in, as well as areas where the student needs additional support. Educators could provide resources to students that help them make informed choices, such as college requirements for admissions, and career paths that will help them reach their professional goals. 

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum has both pros and cons. However, by working collaboratively, educators and parents can help students feel motivated and engaged in their education, whilst ensuring that they receive a comprehensive education by offering guidance and support. Students can learn what they want and what they need, supplementing their interests and sparking motivation, now and in the future.
