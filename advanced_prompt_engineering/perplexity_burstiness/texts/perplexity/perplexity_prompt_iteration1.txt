The debate surrounding the autonomy of high school students to curate their own curriculum is one that has been ongoing for a while. Some argue that students should have the power to choose the subjects they want to study, while others vehemently oppose the idea. It's important to consider various factors before coming to a final conclusion on this subject matter.

First and foremost, the idea of allowing students to choose their own curriculum sounds fair. It is widely believed that students will perform better when they are studying what genuinely interests them. Allowing students to explore their interests would undoubtedly make them more motivated. The enthusiasm which stems from doing something they love will inspire them to learn better and do well in the subjects they are studying. Therefore, students will be more willing to learn if they have a say in what they're learning about.

However, the reality is far more complicated than that. With more and more students opting for certain subjects and others disregarding others, this could lead to staffing and funding issues. This would mean that certain faculties may have to be less populated while others may need to be more staffed, which could directly reduce staff morale and increase workload. This can negatively impact the quality of education that is being provided to students.

Another concern regarding students curating their curriculum is ensuring that they get the well-rounded education they need in high school. This would mean that students could not simply choose the subjects they want to study and ignore everything else. They should be required to study a range of compulsory courses. Many students might heavily bias their choices towards modern technological subjects, which will inevitably lead to the neglect of history, English, philosophy, and other disciplines that are as equally fundamental, but are often viewed as more irrelevant in our contemporary culture.

Moreover, there is the implication of a reduction in standardized metrics that are implemented by educators in the school administrations globally. A pre-planned curriculum guarantees that all students have a basic understanding of certain disciplines. In a world where job skills and assessments are increasingly standardized, high school students who only studied topics that were of interest to them might fall disadvantaged because they would miss out on certain learning outcomes that are crucial to their professional growth prospects.

In conclusion, students curating their own high school curriculum is an intriguing debate. While it is natural to want to give students more freedom to customize their educational experience, the reality is that it could lead to a reduction in academic quality and bias towards certain subjects. Fundamentally, high school students require a comprehensive foundation to equip them with knowledge and skills that they will need in their future professional life. Therefore, the current system of having a pre-arranged syllabus and curriculum structure gives students a formative base before they move on to tertiary education. Students should be encouraged to seek out electives beyond their compulsory subjects that are more related to their interests, but should not be given the entire responsibility of curating their own educational paths.
