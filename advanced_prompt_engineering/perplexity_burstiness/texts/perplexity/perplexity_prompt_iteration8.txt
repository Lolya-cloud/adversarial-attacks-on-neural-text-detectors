The idea of allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum is one that elicits strong opinions on both sides of the debate. On the one hand, some argue that it would be empowering for students to have more control over their education, while others worry that this could lead to a lack of rigor and academic standards. Ultimately, the question of whether or not students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is a complex one that requires us to consider a range of factors, including student autonomy, educational outcomes, and potential drawbacks.

On the pro side of the argument, there are many reasons why allowing students to curate their own curriculum could be beneficial. First and foremost, it would give students a greater sense of ownership over their education, which could increase their motivation and engagement. When students feel like they have more say in what they are learning, they are more likely to be invested in the material and to take an active role in their own learning. Additionally, allowing students to choose their own courses could help them to explore their interests and develop their strengths. Rather than being forced to take classes that they are not passionate about, students could focus on subjects that they are truly passionate about, which could lead to a deeper level of learning and genuine intellectual development.

On the other side of the debate, there are concerns that allowing students to curate their own curriculum could lower academic standards. In a traditional high school setting, there are certain courses that are considered essential for all students in order to meet graduation requirements and be prepared for college or the workforce. If students were allowed to choose their own courses, there is a risk that they would not take all of the necessary ones or would opt for easier or less demanding classes. Additionally, if students were choosing their own curriculum, there could be a lack of consistency across different schools, which could make it difficult to accurately measure academic achievement and compare students. There is also the concern that students who are not yet mature enough to make informed decisions about their education could make poor choices that would negatively impact their future prospects.

Overall, the question of whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum is a complex one that depends on a number of factors. While empowering students to make choices about their education could be beneficial in certain contexts, there are also valid concerns about maintaining educational rigor and ensuring that all students have access to a strong academic foundation. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between allowing students to have agency over their own learning while also ensuring that they receive a high-quality education that prepares them for success in the future. By carefully weighing the pros and cons of this approach and taking a nuanced approach, educators and policymakers can work to create an educational system that prioritizes student autonomy and academic excellence.
