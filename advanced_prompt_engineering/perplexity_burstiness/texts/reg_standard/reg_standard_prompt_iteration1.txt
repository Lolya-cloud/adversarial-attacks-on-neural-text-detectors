The subject of whether high school students should have the ability to curate their curriculum has been a topic of great debate among educators. The current education system is oftentimes criticized for being inflexible and not adequately preparing students for real-life challenges. As such, it is critical to assess the potential advantages and drawbacks of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, as doing so could have far-reaching implications for students’ learning experiences.

One of the primary benefits of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it can foster a greater level of engagement among students. Research has shown that when students are given a sense of ownership over their learning experiences, they become more invested in their education and, as a result, are more motivated to achieve academic success. Allowing students to curate their curriculum could, therefore, be an effective way to enhance their sense of engagement in the classroom.

Another advantage of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it can enable them to pursue their academic interests more fully. While standard curriculums are designed to provide a broad-based education, they may not always allow for students to explore their unique interests and passions. By allowing students to shape their own curriculum, they can take courses that cater to their personal interests and can develop the skills and knowledge necessary for future success.

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could also promote the development of valuable life skills. By giving students the responsibility of organizing and prioritizing their studies, they can learn important skills such as time management, communication, and collaboration. These kinds of skills are essential in preparing for academic and professional success beyond high school.

Despite these potential advantages, there are, of course, some potential risks that must be taken into account. Perhaps the most significant risk of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that they may neglect essential subjects or skills. In some cases, students may not have a clear understanding of the value of certain subjects or may not feel motivated to learn them. Additionally, students may be inclined to focus too heavily on particular subjects that interest them, at the expense of more balanced education.

In conclusion, while there are certainly risks associated with allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, the potential benefits are significant. Allowing for greater student input can promote greater engagement, encourage students to pursue their interests more fully, and help develop critical life skills. To ensure a balanced curriculum and to guard against potential risks, it may be necessary to balance student input in the creation of the syllabus with a set of core required classes. Ultimately, a flexible curriculum that allows for some level of student control over the syllabus could be one of the best ways to help ensure that today’s students are prepared for tomorrow’s challenges.
