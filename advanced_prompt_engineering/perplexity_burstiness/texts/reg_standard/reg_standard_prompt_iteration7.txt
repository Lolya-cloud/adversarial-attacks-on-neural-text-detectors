The debate on whether it is reasonable to allow high school students to curate their own curriculum has been ongoing for decades. With traditional curriculums being standardized, there is a limitation to the range of subjects that can be learned. Allowing students to lead their curriculum can increase their engagement, motivation and academic achievement if implemented effectively. Hence, it is essential to answer the question- "Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?" in the affirmative.

In the first place, student engagement in education will increase if they are allowed to create their high school curriculum. It is not unknown that students will be more engaged in their learning when their interests are catered to specifically. Empowering students to lead their learning process will enable them to discover and explore areas of learning they find interesting and valuable. For instance, some students may be interested in focusing on entrepreneurship, while others may want to learn more about environmentalism. The student-led curriculum can give the student more control over their learning and increase learner engagement and motivation.

Secondly, a student-curated curriculum can lead to significant academic improvement. By combining traditional coursework with interest-driven learning, students would be more active in their education, and desire to achieve higher results. This is because learners who are passionate about what they are studying are more likely to find meaning in the content, ask salient questions, seek feedback, and remember details. When students are immersed in their studies, academic achievements expand as a result of their commitment to learning.

Furthermore, beginning a student-led curriculum will not mean that students will forego essential learning courses. Learners will still have to complete core courses like mathematics, literature, social science, and science but will have an opportunity to pick electives based on interests, goals or academic strengths. This will make students recognize the importance of their learning and see how it pertains to their future plans. They will be able to discover unique skills and abilities and express them in the learning process.

Lastly, allowing students to regulate their high school program would prepare them for the future. One of the primary functions of high schools is to equip students for their future, both academically and career-wise. Allowing students to create their curriculum will enable them to cultivate vital skills that are relevant in the present and the future of our changing workforce. Such skills include communication, critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would have a substantial positive impact on their academic success, engagement, motivation, and future accomplishments. The student-led curriculum ensures that learners are invested in their education, learn subjects that they need to learn within the parameters of a core curriculum and master crucial skills that they will need to thrive in the future. Although there would be teething challenges in implementing a student-led curriculum, the merits it could bring are significant. Thus, school authorities should consider giving their students some freedom to curate their high school curriculum.
