Giving students the ability to choose and design their high school curriculum is a topic that has stirred up debates, but it is beneficial. Therefore, students in high school should be allowed to have control over their curriculum.

The first advantage of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it would boost their engagement and motivation. When students feel like they have a say in their education, they become more engrossed in it. When students are intrigued, they become inspired to learn more. Giving students the power to curate their curriculum would let them study what interests them, making learning more pleasurable.

Another benefit of allowing students to have power over their high school curriculum is that this would produce an experience with a personal touch. Each high school student has different backgrounds, various interests, and unique learning styles. Allowing them to curate their curricula would permit them to customize their education to meet their needs. This would pave the way for a high-quality educational experience for the students, leading to better outcomes.

Furthermore, letting students choose their high school curriculum can help them prepare for their future careers. Typically, in high school curriculums, students are compelled to take specific classes regardless of their intended field of work. However, selecting courses relevant to their interests means that students have a better chance of getting better jobs. Concentrating the student's studies on classes that are connected to their chosen field would allow them to broaden their knowledge and skills.

Finally, it is worth noting that personalized learning can be challenging at first for all education stakeholders, particularly students and instructors, who may need specialized assistance to achieve the expected outcomes. Nevertheless, personalized learning creates more intellectual curiosity, deeper engagement with the content, and increases overall productivity. Students tend to become more attentive and hardworking when they study subjects that they have genuine interest in.

 In conclusion, giving students control over their high school curriculum is advantageous to both students and the education system at large. A personalized learning approach would help high school students shape their future while equipping them with the skills necessary to succeed in their chosen field. Personalized learning has become crucial in the age of technological advancement when various jobs require specialized skills acquisition. Therefore, it is advisable for the education system to consider introducing personalized learning to improve the quality of education.
