The traditional high school experience typically comes with predetermined courses to be followed strictly. However, a few students may desire a more personalized academic experience that aligns with their interests or career aspirations. These students may want to curate their high school curriculum, which raises a question: should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could result in a more engaged and motivated student body. When students have a say in what they are studying, they are more invested in their education and are more likely to take ownership of their learning experience. If students have the opportunity to study topics that they are interested in and passionate about, they are more likely to pursue their education beyond the high school level.

Additionally, personalized curriculums could better prepare students for their future careers. Many students have specific career aspirations that require certain skills and areas of knowledge. By curating their own high school curriculum, students could focus on developing these skills and gaining the knowledge needed to succeed in their chosen field.

However, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could result in an unequal education system. Students in more financially well-off areas with better resources could have an advantage in creating a more diverse and comprehensive curriculum, while students in lower-income areas may not have similar opportunities.

Furthermore, there may be concerns about how students would choose their courses and what criteria they would use. Additionally, there are practical considerations. High schools might not have the resources to offer a wide variety of courses. Additionally, too many students may pursue courses on a certain topic, making it challenging to find enough qualified teachers to fill all the classes, leaving some students without courses.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school course experience can have both positive and negative implications. While personalized curriculums may result in more engaged and motivated students and better prepare the students for their future careers, it could also lead to an unequal education system and raise concerns about the students' decision-making process when selecting courses. Some schools already provide limited opportunities for personalized learning, such as Advanced Placement programs or dual enrollment courses. Ultimately, whether or not high school students should be allowed to tailor their curriculum should be decided on a school-to-school basis, with consideration given to resources and fairness of implementation.
