High school curriculum curation by students is a controversial topic that has generated much debate. I believe that high school students should have the power to curate their own curriculum since it can lead to several benefits such as improved academic results, increased motivation, and early identification of potential career paths.

The objective of high school education is to prepare students for the future, and the traditional education system with its "one-size-fits-all" approach has not been able to cater to the unique characteristics of individual students. Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses that can be optimized if the curriculum is tailored to their specific needs. For example, if a student is more interested in science than literature, they should be able to take more science courses instead of literature courses. A personalized education approach will enable students to get better academic results and also make the learning process more engaging and active.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their own curriculum will increase their motivation towards learning, which is often lacking in the traditional classroom environment. A flexible learning process can inspire and challenge students to engage deeply in their subjects of interest. If students feel they are in control of their own learning journey and can learn from subjects they are passionate about, it can significantly increase motivation and lead to better academic outcomes.

Above all, customized curriculums can help students to identify potential career paths early in their lives. Most high school students are often clueless about their future career goals after graduation. But with curation, students can pick subjects they are interested in, which can lead to an early shaping of their career path. For instance, if a student is interested in Medicine, stocking up on more Biology, Chemistry, and Health courses can introduce them to basic medical knowledge that could be beneficial later on if they decide to pursue Medicine as a career.

Although some people oppose curriculum customization, arguing that students still need guidance on core subjects, such as Math, and English, this argument doesn't hold water. In a customized approach, students will still take the important subjects; they will just do so while incorporating their interests and learning potential.

In conclusion, high school students should have the power to curate their own curriculums. Personalized education can optimize each student's capabilities and help them achieve better academic results, be more motivated and engage in their studies better, and identify potential career paths early. The traditional education system must evolve to better meet the needs of today's generation, and students' individuality and potentialities should take center stage in devised curricula.
