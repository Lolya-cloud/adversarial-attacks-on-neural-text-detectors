High school students should curate their own curriculum - that's the question on the table. For years, high school curriculums have been set in stone by the powers that be, but as society shifts to a more student-centered approach, some suggest that students should be able to have a say in their education. So, is it a good idea?

The answer isn't straightforward. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could have some serious benefits. For starters, students would be more engaged and motivated to learn if they have a sense of ownership over their education. When students have control over what they're learning, they're more likely to be interested in the material and involved in their academic endeavors. This increased engagement can lead to higher achievement and lower rates of absenteeism.

Plus, a personalized curriculum allows students to focus on their own goals and areas of interests. For example, a student who wants to pursue a career in journalism could take media literacy and writing-focused courses, while a scientifically minded student could enroll in astronomy or biology. Giving students the opportunity to pursue their interests can make learning more meaningful and relevant.

But not everyone is convinced that allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum is a good idea. One potential drawback is that students may not know what they want to learn, leading to an unbalanced or incomplete curriculum that doesn't prepare them for their future. Additionally, the freedom to choose courses could lead students to shy away from more challenging coursework and opt for courses that are easier.

There's also the issue of actually facilitating a personalized curriculum. In small, underfunded school systems, resources and course offerings may be limited, making it difficult for students to enroll in the classes they want. This could lead to online coursework or self-directed study instead of classroom instruction.

So, what's the solution? Perhaps the best approach is a balance between flexibility and guidance. High schools could offer a selection of pre-approved courses or specialized tracks for different academic interests while ensuring that all students complete a core set of subjects.

What's important is that educators and administrators take a collaborative approach to student learning, creating an educational experience that's both engaging and comprehensive. By providing students with the critical thinking skills and knowledge they need to succeed, high school curriculums can help shape the future of our society.
