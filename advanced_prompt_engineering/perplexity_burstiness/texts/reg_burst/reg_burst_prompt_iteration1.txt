High school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum. The current one-size-fits-all model does not cater to individual needs and preferences. By designing their own coursework, students would be better motivated, engaged, and successful. This would develop critical life skills, and provide a greater sense of responsibility and accountability.

Traditionally, education relies on rigid structures and places a great emphasis on conformity. This view overlooks the fact that every individual is unique and may have different interests, strengths, and weaknesses. This is why schools should allow students to create a tailored academic path. By giving them control over their own education, it would motivate them to study subjects that they enjoy, leading to more engagement and a higher graduation rate.

When students curate their own curriculum, they have a greater sense of responsibility and accountability. With the power to create their own academic path, they would feel a greater sense of ownership and pride in their coursework. They would be compelled to take their studies much more seriously and work harder to achieve their desired goals.

Designing their own curriculum would be very beneficial in developing critical life skills. Students would learn how to take control over their learning journey, how to research, analyze, collate, and present information, as well as, how to make sound judgements regarding their future. Such critical skills are essential in higher education or employment and would be useful in daily decision-making processes.

While there are some concerns that students might become too absorbed in one area and neglect others, these are an unfounded fear. With more control over their education, they would be likely to excel in their studies and give themselves the flexibility to study outside of their interests and overcome academic challenges. Schools can provide much-needed support and guidance to ensure students are not limiting themselves to only one subject area.

In conclusion, it is time for schools to give students the autonomy to create their own coursework. It would provide a more tailored and engaging education, encourage learners to have more control over their learning journey, and develop critical life skills that would be beneficial in their future careers. It should be the norm rather than an exception since it would positively impact learnersâ€™ academic excellence and future career prospects.
