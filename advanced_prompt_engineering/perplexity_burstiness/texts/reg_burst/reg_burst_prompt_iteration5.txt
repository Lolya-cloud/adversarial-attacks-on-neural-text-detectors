Education is supposed to change with the times and be inclusive of varied interests. Yet, conventional curriculums aren't suitable for every student as they're not tailored to individual needs. This is where the concept of student-centred learning comes in, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Stakeholders in education should consider this approach.

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum provides quality education. Students have different strengths, interests, and ways of learning, which the current curriculum may not cater to. With a tailor-made curriculum, students can focus on their strengths and explore their passions. This enables them to learn in a way that's compatible with their learning styles. Thus, students can receive a bespoke education that promotes their talents.

A flexible curriculum is critical to every student's success. Allowing students to select their courses provides a great way for them to achieve their goals. For instance, if a student has a passion for entrepreneurship, they can select courses such as business studies, economics and accounting, enabling them to acquire the necessary skills. By doing so, students are more willing to put effort into learning.

Encouraging students to curate their high school curriculum has a positive ripple effect on the community. Students who follow their interests enjoy learning and become successful, hence becoming assets to society. The approach promotes hard work and ethical behaviour as students learn to apply themselves to their interests. Additionally, this approach promotes mutual respect in a diverse society to prepare students for future challenges.

Critics argue that allowing students to tailor their high school curriculum can result in redundancy and gaps in their education. However, this approach can still cover core subjects, such as mathematics, languages and sciences. Students can still be required to undergo mandatory subjects and tests to join a university. The curriculum can also be examined and simplified further to ensure students have the right balance and coverage.

In summary, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is essential in promoting quality education. It allows students to focus on what they enjoy, develop their skills and fulfil their ambitions. This creates a vibrant student community, where hard work, respect and ethical behaviours are anchored. Therefore, stakeholders and the government should consider this flexible curriculum approach to nurture students' interests and academics for overall development.
