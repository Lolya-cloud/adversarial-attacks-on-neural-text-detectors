Schools should allow students to choose their high school curriculum. Advocates of this idea argue that it motivates students and prepares them for college. However, opponents argue that it could lead to academic languor, irresponsibility, and confusion.

One of the main arguments for allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it will engage and motivate them more. When students are able to choose courses that interest them, they are more likely to be invested in what they're learning, leading to better academic performance and higher graduation rates. Allowing students to choose their own curriculum may also help them develop essential skills that prepare them for future jobs.

On the other hand, some argue that when students are given too much freedom, they may choose courses that are too easy or do not challenge them, which can lead to academic languor. Furthermore, when students can choose their own coursework, it can lead to unpredictability in scheduling classes and teacher hiring.

Another advantage of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it can help them prepare for college. When students are allowed to choose their classes, they are often better equipped to study at the college level, where they must be more self-directed and take greater responsibility for their education. Additionally, exposure to a wide range of subjects and disciplines can help students figure out what they want to major in, reducing the number of students who switch majors and delays in graduation or financial expenses.

Yet, opponents argue that high school is a time for students to learn fundamental skills and knowledge, and allowing them to choose their own curriculum can result in them bypassing essential courses that may be critical for their overall success in later years. Additionally, some students may not have the skills necessary to make wise choices when choosing courses and may select courses that do not benefit them in the long run.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum is a topic that arouses intense debate. While it is true that giving students the freedom to choose their own courses can make them more motivated and confident in their academic work, it must not compromise quality and critical educational milestones. Careful consideration must be given to subjects to redistrict, levels of choice to assign, and overall educational goals. Ultimately, the objective should be to create well-rounded individuals who are well prepared to take on the challenges that will be presented to them beyond the walls of high school.
