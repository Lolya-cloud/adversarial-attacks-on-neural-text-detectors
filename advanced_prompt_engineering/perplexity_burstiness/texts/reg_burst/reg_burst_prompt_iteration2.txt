A high school curriculum usually has a standard set of subjects that students must learn at the same pace. Nevertheless, this approach has some weaknesses as every student is unique and has different interests and learning levels. Therefore, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum according to their preferences and career goals.

When students create a customized high school curriculum, they can opt for the subjects they are most interested in, which can improve their grades significantly. By choosing classes that align with their future career plans, students can focus on developing their skills and abilities, increasing their confidence in their academic achievements.

Most students often struggle to connect what they learn in school to the real world. However, when students curate their high school curriculum, they can focus on how they can apply their knowledge beyond the classroom. For instance, a student interested in the arts can take art classes that will enable them to improve their skills and even create future career opportunities.

Additionally, curating a high school curriculum allows students to learn self-discipline and time-management skills. They must organize their schedule carefully, ensuring they have enough time to complete their assignments effectively. These skills become useful in the future as they can apply them to their careers effectively.

However, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can present some challenges. Some students may only pick the subjects that they enjoy, neglecting the subjects they need for college admission. This disadvantage could hinder their academic advancement.

Moreover, without a standardized curriculum, students may excel in some subjects and lag in others, leading to an unbalanced education. A standardized curriculum ensures that every student learns the essential subjects, providing a comprehensive understanding of subjects such as language, math, and science.

Another challenge of curation of a high school curriculum is that not all students may have the resources to choose the best courses for them. Wealthy students may have an advantage over others if they have access to private tutors and better study materials. Consequently, this may create an imbalance in academic opportunity and results.

In conclusion, customizable high school curricula offer various advantages but also presents some challenges. Students who curate their curriculum have a high level of confidence, develop critical skills, and have a better opportunity to pursue their interests and career goals. The education system needs to be flexible and allow students a degree of control over their high school curriculum while maintaining a balance between the institution's requirements and the students' academic and career goals.
