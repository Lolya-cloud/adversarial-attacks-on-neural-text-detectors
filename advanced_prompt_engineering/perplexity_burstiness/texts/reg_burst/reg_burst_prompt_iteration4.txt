The debate on whether or not students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum has been ongoing for years. Currently, students have little to no say in the curriculum, and it is rigid and standardized. However, some scholars believe that students should be allowed to curate their curriculum, as it can lead to more personalized learning experiences.

When students are given the freedom to curate their high school curriculum, it can generate a more personalized education experience. Every student has unique interests, passions, and preferred learning styles that may be better accommodated if they are given a choice. A personalized curriculum would permit students to focus on subjects they find relevant and captivating, thereby making the learning process more engaging and eventually yielding to a more excellent academic performance. This approach can create a sense of ownership in the learning process, leading to increased motivation, initiative, and accountability.

Allowing students to curate their curriculum can also help to develop their self-direction and time management skills. As they select the subjects they want to learn, they also have to take responsibility for managing their schedules and learning at their own pace. This practice can help students develop a sense of independence that is useful, not only in the learning process, but also in their future careers and daily lives. Moreover, it can improve students' ability to manage their time effectively, which can be an asset in their future endeavors.

Some argue that allowing students to curate their curriculum could lead to lopsided educational experiences that lack core knowledge and understanding. They argue that students may only select subjects that are easy or enjoyable, ignoring the difficult or less interesting subjects that are essential. However, closely monitored and designed curriculum building processes can address this problem. A leading instructor or advisor could guide and steer the students’ choices of subjects to ensure they cover core knowledge that is required for educational objectives. Additionally, by setting higher standards and providing more support for more challenging subjects, schools can ensure that students do not overlook vital subjects due to their inclination towards a particular subject.

Another advantage of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that students can have a more holistic knowledge approach. Schools often attempt to cram as much information as possible within four walls, limiting students’ exposure to other relevant life experiences. With a self-curated curriculum, students can explore topics that are of interest to them, extending their learning outside of the classroom. This approach exposes students to diverse perspectives and ideas, and it helps them develop a well-rounded view, preparing them for real-life applications.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum provides several advantages that should not be neglected. It provides an opportunity for personalized learning, promotes self-direction and time management skills, and exposes students to a holistic learning approach. However, it is crucial to guide the curriculum building process to ensure that it aligns with larger educational objectives. By wisely implementing this approach, students can have the best possible educational experience and grow into well-rounded individuals.
