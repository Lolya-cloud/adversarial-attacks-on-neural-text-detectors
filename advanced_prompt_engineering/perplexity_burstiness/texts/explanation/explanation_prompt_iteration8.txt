The topic of whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum has sparked a lot of debate and discussion in recent years. Some argue that students should have more control over what they learn in school, while others believe that leaving such decisions in the hands of educators is the safer and more responsible approach. Ultimately, both sides have valid arguments, and it is up to us to weigh the pros and cons before coming to a conclusion on the matter.

One of the main arguments in support of student-curated curriculum is that it would increase engagement and motivation. Many studies have shown that students are more likely to be interested and engaged in course material that they have chosen themselves. By giving students a choice in what they learn, they are more likely to feel invested in the material and therefore more likely to excel in their studies. Furthermore, when students have control over their own education, they are able to pursue their interests and passions more fully, leading to a greater sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.

Another argument in favor of student-curated curriculum is that it would better prepare students for the real world. In college and in the workforce, individuals are often required to take more initiative and make decisions based on their own preferences and interests. By allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum, we would be giving them the opportunity to hone these skills before they enter the workforce or continue their education.

On the other hand, some argue that students are not yet equipped to make such decisions. They argue that students lack the necessary knowledge and experience to make informed decisions about their education. Teachers and educational professionals have spent years studying education and learning, and they have a better sense of what students need to learn in order to succeed in the future. Allowing students to curate their own curriculum could result in students missing out on important lessons and concepts that they would not have chosen themselves.

Additionally, it can be argued that student-curated curriculum is simply not practical. High school students often lack the maturity and foresight to understand the long-term effects of the decisions they make. They may choose courses that are too easy or too difficult, or they may fail to consider the prerequisites necessary for advanced courses. This could lead to inefficient use of time and resources, as well as potentially harmful effects on the student's future academic and career goals.

In conclusion, the debate over student-curated curriculum is complex and multifaceted. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a system before making any decisions. Ultimately, it may be possible to strike a balance by allowing students some degree of choice and input in their educational pathways while ensuring that they have the support and guidance necessary to make informed decisions about their future.
