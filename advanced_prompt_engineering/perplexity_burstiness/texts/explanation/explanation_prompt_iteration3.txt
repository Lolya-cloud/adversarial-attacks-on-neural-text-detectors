It is no secret that high school curriculum can be quite regimented, with students being given little control over what they learn. However, as the world changes, it seems only logical that the education system should adapt to keep up. In this regard, one could argue that high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum.

The first reason why students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is that it would provide them with a sense of agency in their education. For too long, students have been expected to follow a predetermined path that may or may not fit their interests and strengths. This can lead to disengagement and an overall lack of motivation to learn. By giving students control over what they learn, they are more likely to be invested in their education and take a more active role in the process.

Another benefit of allowing students to curate their curriculum is that it would better prepare them for life outside of high school. In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world, the ability to be adaptable and learn new things is vital. Teaching students to take charge of their education and to identify what they want to learn will prepare them for a future where they may need to constantly evolve and learn new skill sets.

Of course, the idea of allowing students to curate their own curriculum is not without its challenges. Some may argue that students do not have the necessary knowledge or skills to determine what they should learn. However, this concern is easily addressed by providing students with guidance and support. Teachers and guidance counselors, for instance, can work with students to help them identify their interests and goals and to suggest appropriate courses of study.

A second challenge is the potential for inequity. Students from marginalized backgrounds may not have access to the same educational resources as their peers, which could put them at a disadvantage when selecting courses. This concern can be addressed by providing students with equal access to information about available courses and by offering support to those who may need it.

In conclusion, there are strong arguments in favor of allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum. By doing so, students are more likely to be engaged in their education, better prepared for life outside of high school, and able to develop skills such as self-direction and adaptation. While there are certainly challenges to this approach, these can be addressed with proper guidance and thoughtful consideration. Ultimately, it is time for the education system to shift away from a one-size-fits-all approach and towards a model that better reflects the needs and interests of individual students.
