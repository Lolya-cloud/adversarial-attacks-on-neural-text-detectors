The education system worldwide has always been a topic of debate among educators, students, and parents alike. One of the questions that frequently come up is whether students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum according to their individual interests and ambitions. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of schools offering more personalized and customized education, and the idea of allowing high school students to choose their courses is a part of it. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum.

On the one hand, letting students have the freedom to select their courses lets them pursue their interests and passions actively. It encourages students to take responsibility for their education, as they are involved in the decision-making process. They can, therefore, choose courses that they are passionate about, which would make learning more enjoyable and more effective. With students picking classes that align with their aspirations, they would have greater motivation and enthusiasm for their studies, which would translate to higher academic performance.

Moreover, students would learn practical skills that they could apply in real-life scenarios, which is a practical application of knowledge – a concept that is more beneficial than memorizing rote information. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum presents opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills, which are imperative in all aspects of life. By choosing subjects that speak to their ambitions, students can have a more holistic and practical high school experience that aligns with their objectives and goals.

On the other hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to lopsided education, where students overlook some essential subjects that are of fundamental importance in their overall education. A student's choices may be limited to subjects they already know or enjoy, resulting in missed opportunities to broaden their perspective on issues and topics. To a large extent, students may not yet have a clear idea of what they need to study for their future based on their interests. Therefore, they may not make the best decisions, leading to the exclusion of specific topics from their curriculum. This could be detrimental to their future prospects.

Furthermore, allowing students to pick their courses could potentially create resentment among teachers, departments, or other students. For instance, some students may opt for many advanced classes, leaving some courses with fewer students. This may cause teachers to put in extra work to create more challenging courses, which could lead to burnout. Additionally, the idea of “streaming” (or ability grouping based on academic performance) might be divisive, with some students feeling excluded from more advanced courses, thus creating an unhealthy environment of competition and elitism.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is a complex issue with both advantages and disadvantages. However, with a few modifications, such as career counseling and teacher guidance, the concept could be successfully implemented, leading to students receiving a more tailored education. Students may gain significant benefits, such as greater motivation and enthusiasm and practical application of knowledge, while also having a more comprehensive high school experience. However, care should be taken so that the curriculum remains balanced, and all students, regardless of academic level, have equal opportunities for success.
