In today's educational system, the curriculum is decided by the authorities and teachers, which is rigid and inflexible. Nowadays, many students feel disengaged in their studies, which has resulted in low grades and poor academic performance. But, what if students could curate their high school curriculum? It would give them a sense of autonomy and motivation towards their studies.

Allowing high school students to curate their curriculum has become a subject of debate. While some believe that it would enhance the educational experience, others think it would do more harm than good. This essay makes a case for why school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

The first reason why students should be allowed to curate their curriculum is that it would provide a sense of autonomy and control over their education. When students choose their subjects, they feel more engaged and enthusiastic about learning. They are more likely to take ownership of their education and feel invested in their own academic progress. By giving students more control over their education, schools can create a more student-centered learning experience.

Secondly, students would be able to explore their interests and passions in a deeper way. Currently, high school curriculums are designed to be broad and cover a range of subjects. It often leaves no space for students to delve deeply into the topics or subjects that interest them. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, they would have the opportunity to study what they are interested in on a more in-depth level, which would lead to better understanding, retention, and enjoyment of the subject.

Thirdly, the current education system is rigid, and students are required to take certain courses regardless of their interests or future career goals. These mandatory courses can be a source of frustration and lead to disengagement with studies. Allowing students to choose their curriculum would reflect their interests and career aspirations, and they would be more motivated to learn the material.

Another critical aspect of curating the curriculum by the students is that it would build a sense of responsibility and accountability. By making choices, they would have to take responsibility for their choices and the consequences. They would be more accountable for their academic performance, which would lead to higher academic achievement.

Of course, some opponents might argue that allowing students to curate their curriculum could lead to narrow-mindedness and stereotyping. However, this is not likely to be the case as universities demand a broad range of high school subjects, in addition to expecting good grades. Universities are prudent and selective, and they want to admit students who show great academic potential, regardless of the subjects they have studied.

To conclude, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum would be advantageous for various reasons. It would provide students with a sense of autonomy and control over their education, enable them to explore their interests and passions in a more in-depth manner, reflect on their career aspirations, and promote responsibility and accountability. Thus, it is high time that schools empower students to curate their curriculum and create a more student-centered learning experience.
