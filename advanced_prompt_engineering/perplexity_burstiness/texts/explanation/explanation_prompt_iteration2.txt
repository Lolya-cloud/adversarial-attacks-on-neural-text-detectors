In recent years, there has been an ongoing debate about whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. While some argue that this approach could benefit students, others believe that it may lead to issues such as students avoiding essential subjects. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the most significant benefits of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is that it allows them to focus on their interests. By selecting courses that align with their career goals or personal passions, students can become more motivated and engaged with their studies. Furthermore, this approach can help students develop a deeper understanding of their chosen subjects, which can be helpful when applying to university or searching for employment opportunities.

Another advantage of curating a high school curriculum could be that it would lead to less stress and pressure on students. A pre-set curriculum can be overwhelming for some students, leading to anxiety and burnout. By allowing students to curate their own curriculum, they may feel less pressured and find it easier to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

On the flip side, there are some potential drawbacks to allowing students to curate their curriculum. One concern is that students may focus on subjects they enjoy and avoid important subjects that they find challenging. This could result in a significant gap in their education, leading to difficulties in higher education or the workforce.

Another potential issue is that not all students may have access to the same resources or be able to make informed decisions when curating their curriculum. In some cases, high-performing students may select more challenging courses, whereas underperforming students may choose easier ones. This could ultimately lead to disparities in academic achievement and future career prospects.

In conclusion, while there are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing high school students to curate their curriculum, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. By allowing students to focus on their interests and reducing the pressure associated with a pre-set curriculum, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated in their studies. However, measures must be put in place to ensure that all students have access to the same resources and that they are making informed decisions. Ultimately, it is up to schools and educational policymakers to work together to find a balance between flexibility and maintaining academic rigor.
