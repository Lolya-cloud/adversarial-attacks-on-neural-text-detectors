School students have traditionally had a limited ability to curate their high school curriculum, with the vast majority of their classes and coursework being mandated by the school or state. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to allow students more autonomy in selecting their high school classes and coursework. Proponents of this movement argue that allowing students to curate their own curriculum can improve engagement and motivation, better prepare students for college and careers, and provide a more personalized educational experience. But is this approach really feasible and effective? 

One argument for allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum is that it can increase engagement and motivation. Under the current system, students often feel disinterested and disconnected from their coursework, as they are forced to take classes that do not align with their interests or goals. By allowing students to choose their own classes and coursework, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated in their studies. Students can pursue subjects that interest them or align with future career aspirations. This can ultimately lead to higher grades and more effective learning.

Another argument for allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum is that it can better prepare them for college and careers. By choosing their own classes and coursework, students can gain experience in areas that are relevant to their career goals or college majors. For example, a student interested in engineering can take more advanced math and science courses, while a student interested in journalism can take writing and communications classes. This gives students a head start in their college or career journey and can make them more marketable to employers.

Lastly, allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum provides a more personalized educational experience. Every student is unique, with their own learning style, interests, and strengths. By allowing students to choose their own classes and coursework, schools can tailor the curriculum to each student's needs and abilities. This can lead to a more effective and meaningful educational experience.

However, while there are certainly benefits to allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum, there are also potential downsides. For example, students may not have the expertise or knowledge to make informed decisions about their coursework. A student may choose to take courses that are not challenging enough or too challenging, which can impact their academic success. Additionally, students may not have access to the resources they need to pursue their chosen coursework, such as specialized teachers or facilities.

Another potential downside is the impact on equity. Allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum may exacerbate existing inequalities in the education system. Students from wealthier backgrounds may have more access to specialized coursework or educational resources, while students from disadvantaged backgrounds may not. This could widen the achievement gap and prevent some students from reaching their full potential.

In conclusion, the question of whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is a complex one. While there are certainly benefits to allowing students more autonomy in selecting their classes and coursework, there are also potential downsides to consider. Ultimately, it is up to schools, educators, and policymakers to balance the benefits and potential drawbacks of this approach and determine the best way forward for their students.
