In the current education system, high school students are often presented with a predetermined set of courses that they must take in order to meet graduation requirements. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether or not students should be allowed to curate their own high school curriculum. This would give students the freedom to choose the courses they want to take based on their interests and career aspirations. In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum.

The idea of allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum can lead to benefits. Firstly, it can provide students with a sense of ownership and accountability in their education. When students are given the opportunity to choose their own courses, they are more likely to be invested in their studies. They are more likely to work harder in the courses they choose and participate more actively in the classroom.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can lead to a more individualized approach to education. Every student is different and has their own unique interests and goals. When students are allowed to choose courses that align with their interests and goals, they are more likely to be engaged in their education. Students who are engaged and motivated are more likely to succeed in their studies and be well-prepared for their future endeavors.

However, there are potential drawbacks to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Firstly, some students may not have a clear idea of what courses are necessary for their future goals. Without guidance from teachers or counselors, they may choose courses that do not align with their future aspirations. This could result in a lack of preparation for their future academic or career endeavors.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to a lack of diversity in educational experiences. Students may choose to focus solely on courses in their areas of interest, which could limit their exposure to other disciplines and areas of study. This could result in a lack of well-roundedness in their education.

In conclusion, while there are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum, a balance can be struck. Giving students the ability to choose some of their courses can provide them with ownership and a sense of accountability in their education, as well as a more individualized approach to their studies. However, it is necessary to provide students with guidance to ensure that they choose courses that align with their future goals, and to encourage them to take a variety of courses that will contribute to a well-rounded education. Overall, the decision of whether or not to allow students to curate their high school curriculum depends on the individual needs and goals of each student.
