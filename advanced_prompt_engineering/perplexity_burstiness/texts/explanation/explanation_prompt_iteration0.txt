The modern-day education system has come a long way, but it is still far from perfect. One of the major issues facing the education system is the rigidity of the curriculum. Students often find it challenging to make sense of what they are taught as it may not be relevant to their interests, future career aspirations, or learning styles.

This issue can be solved by allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum. Curating the curriculum means that students would have the freedom to pick and choose the subjects they want to learn, the courses they want to take, and also the teaching style that suits them best. In other words, they would have the opportunity to create a customized learning experience that meets their unique needs.

The idea of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may seem daunting at first. However, it has its benefits, which far outweigh any risks. Firstly, it would create a sense of ownership among students. When students have the opportunity to play an active role in their learning, they are far more likely to be engaged and motivated. This would also help students to develop a love for learning which is more important than any specific curriculum.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would enable them to pursue their passions. Everyone has unique interests, and the traditional curriculum may not necessarily cater to every student's passions. By letting students curate their courses, they would be able to explore and learn about what they are passionate about. This would not only benefit students, but it would also expose them to a range of subjects they may not have otherwise learned about.

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their curriculum would enable them to decide how they want to learn. Some students may learn best through hands-on experiences, while others may learn best through lectures or discussions. By having the freedom to choose their preferred teaching style, students would be able to maximize their potential and learn more effectively.

It is essential to recognize that allowing students to curate their curriculum does not mean they would be solely responsible for their education. Teachers and counselors would still play a key role in advising and guiding students. Students would also need to meet certain requirements to graduate, which would ensure that they are still gaining the essential skills required for their future success.

In conclusion, curating the high school curriculum is a revolutionary idea that could transform the traditional education system. It would enable students to take ownership of their learning and pursue their passions. It would also help students develop a love for learning and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the future. While there are certain risks associated with this approach, the benefits of allowing students to curate their curriculum outweigh these risks. It is high time that we start considering this approach seriously and implement it in our education system.
