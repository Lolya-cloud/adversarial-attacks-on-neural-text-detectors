As a former high school student, I know firsthand the challenges of sitting through classes that feel irrelevant or uninteresting. Admittedly, it’s hard to be engaged in something you’re not passionate about—and that’s true for all of us, whether we’re in high school or not. Let’s face it: one size does not fit all when it comes to education. Each student has different learning styles, interests, and long-term objectives. That’s why it is a good idea to allow high school students to curate their curriculum.

Think about it. When was the last time you truly felt passionate about what you were learning in school? If you’re struggling to remember, you’re not alone. The fact is that most students endure the high school experience rather than enjoy it. Studies have shown that when students choose what they want to learn, they are more invested in the coursework and more successful academically. When students are able to take control of their curriculum, they feel a sense of empowerment and ownership in their education that can have a long-lasting impact.

At the same time, there’s no getting around the fact that choosing a curriculum is a challenge. Not all students have a clear idea of what they want to do with their lives. However, providing more guidance and support in this area is a great way to help students hone in on their interests and strengths. School counselors can work with students to devise a curriculum that aligns with their goals. Career aptitude tests can also help students gain a better understanding of what areas they may want to explore. Students should be encouraged to engage in extracurricular activities as well as academic courses to gain a well-rounded education.

But isn’t there a reason why there’s a standardized curriculum to begin with? The argument has always been that students need to learn the basics before they can specialize. However, times have changed. With the advent of the internet and global information access, students can learn the “basics” on their own. In fact, many students are already doing just that. Khan Academy, for example, provides free education on a variety of subjects for all ages. High school students can utilize internet resources to learn new things, bringing more flexibility to the high school experience.

Real life examples show how choosing one's curriculum can bring great success. A great example is that of Sabrina Pasterski who is a young scientist and engineer. She graduated from MIT and then went on to conduct research at Harvard University. Her success is a result of her being able to create her own curriculum, especially in high school where she was homeschooled. This flexibility allowed her enough time to focus on her passion for aerospace engineering. Another example is the Khan Academy where founder Salman Khan saw that the system was failing his relative after doing the regular curriculum, so he decided to empower him by letting him take control of his learning and this resulted in him doing extremely well.

In conclusion, the benefits of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum are tremendous. From increased engagement in courses to more ownership of one’s education, it’s an idea that makes sense for students. While this change may be challenging and require new methods of academic support, the reality is that students stand to gain a lot from it. Imagine a world where students are excited to go to school because they’re passionate about what they’re learning. That’s the kind of world that could be possible if we allow students to choose their educational path. So, why not give it a try?
