As a high school student, I often wonder why I can’t have a say in what I learn in school. It’s an undeniable fact that education is essential, but we students have little to no control over our high school curriculum. Should we be allowed to curate our own high school curriculum? In my opinion, the answer is a resounding yes.

It’s a well-known fact that high school students are of a more mature age group and are capable of making informed decisions. Therefore, the idea of ​​freeing students from the traditional constraints of the curriculum can be empowering. But this freedom does not come without responsibility. The challenge for educators lies in finding a way to balance the autonomy granted to students with the academic rigors that are expected from any high school program. However, those concerns should not be an obstacle to disallow students from having a say in the courses they wish to take.

Traditional high school curriculums hold students back from exploring their passions and identifying their key interests. With today’s technology, with more access to knowledge than anyone before us, we should be given room to learn other skills apart from the basic ones taught in formal education. The current curriculum doesn’t provide enough room for students to master their crafts, leaving many talented individuals feeling unfulfilled and possibly losing interest in their education. Furthermore, allowing students to choose their subjects would likely result in more people obtaining an in-depth knowledge of their subjects of interest.

Of course, there are limitations to this freedom and it must be done within reason. There need to be structures and guidelines put in place to ensure that students don’t make irresponsible choices. Schools should organize seminars and meetings with students to guide them while making smart choices concerning their choices. Educators can also enlighten students on some basic educational principles to help them make comprehensive decisions. Additionally, taking these additional steps could essentially lead to students taking up more opportunities, a critical part of life before graduation.

Surprisingly, this concept is not entirely new. Many progressive high schools across the world have already adopted a personalized approach to teaching. Schools like The Lab School of Washington, located in Washington D.C have already developed custom curriculums for every student. One might say it's a gradual evolution from the earlier model of Montessori schools, where the mechanism of learning was by giving children the freedom to choose the activities they wanted to work on.

Ultimately, given the advantages, it's time schools considered implementing it into the mainstream education system.

In conclusion, a personalized curriculum holds significant educational value. It gives a learning scenario that is more authentic and empowering to students. In that scenario, students are essentially in charge of their learning. They take ownership and responsibility for what they learn. It's structured in a way that allows students to follow their natural curiosity and find their place in the world, addressing the question, "What are my interests? What do I want to learn and why?.” And who can argue against that? It's time for a discussion, and it's about time that today's high school students had the freedom to choose their educational path. By doing so, we can establish education as a life-long pursuit that continues well after graduation.
