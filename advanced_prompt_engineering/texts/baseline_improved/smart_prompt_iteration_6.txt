As a former high school student, I often found myself feeling uninspired and unchallenged by the curriculum. The prescribed courses felt dry and irrelevant, removing any sense of autonomy I had over my own education. This led me to wonder: should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

On the one hand, a set curriculum ensures that all students receive the same foundational education. It ensures that all students have the same opportunities as each other and are prepared to tackle college or enter the workforce. But on the other hand, it removes students' individuality, creativity and motivation to learn. 

Allowing students to curate their own curriculum would provide a sense of ownership to their education. With curating their own school subjects, students would have the realization that their education truly belongs to them. They could tailor their classes to their interests, which might spark a passion for learning that would not have been possible in a predetermined curriculum. Students would be given the chance to learn through their own curiosity, which would, in turn, create a more effective and engaging educational environment.

But how would this work in practice? It could be possible to allow students to choose elective courses as they often do in high school, except this time it would be with a greater emphasis on student choice and decision-making power. Students could be given more opportunities to explore subjects theyâ€™re interested in or pursue extracurricular activities that align with their passions. Additionally, technology could help deliver curated courses, allowing students to complete their chosen curriculum through online learning modules.

However, allowing students to choose their high school curriculum may result in some students choosing courses that do not prepare them for their future. This brings up the question: if students do not have more generalized classes like English and Math, how will they learn the essential skills that they will need in their future career?

Despite these concerns, the benefits of allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum would far outweigh the drawbacks. We have to remember that the current generation of students is fundamentally different from those that have come before. They are more ambitious, technologically literate and capable of learning at their own pace. They are ready to take charge of their education and forge their own unique path towards success.

In conclusion, school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Allowing them to take control of their education would provide them with a sense of independence, motivation and ownership over their learning. Furthermore, this would allow them to explore their interests and passions, resulting in a more enjoyable and engaging educational experience. While there are some valid concerns with this method, the benefits far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Schools should be prepared to adapt curriculums to fit the individual needs and goals of every student, opening up the potential for a transformative and meaningful education. After all, it is the goal of every school to prepare students for the challenges of the world ahead, and this is the perfect way to empower students for success in the 21st century.
