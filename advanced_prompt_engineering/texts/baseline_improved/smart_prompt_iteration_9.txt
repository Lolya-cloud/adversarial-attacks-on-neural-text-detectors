As we shift towards a more student-led approach to education, the question arises: should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? The answer to this question may seem simple at first glance, but it requires a lot more thought and consideration. After all, the curriculum is the backbone of any educational institution, and it determines what knowledge and skills a student will have when they step out into the real world. This essay will explore the pros and cons of allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum, and will come to a conclusion based on the available evidence.

On the one hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can be beneficial to their personal growth. It gives them the freedom to choose the courses and subjects that interest them, and enables them to pursue their passions from a young age. This can lead to greater engagement and motivation in learning, and ultimately lead to a more fulfilling academic experience. It also encourages independent thinking and decision-making, skills that are crucial in today's economy. Moreover, personalizing the curriculum ensures that students are taught relevant skills that are in demand in the job market.

On the other hand, there are certain challenges that come with allowing students to curate their own curriculum. For instance, some students may choose to avoid challenging courses or subjects in favor of more comfortable ones. This could lead to a lopsided education that is not sufficiently comprehensive. Additionally, widely varying curriculum content can make it challenging to assess and compare students' learning outcomes. It may also be difficult to ensure equal opportunity to education, as some students may not have access to certain courses or resources required to curate a good curriculum.

Despite these challenges, more and more schools are taking on innovative approaches to curriculum design that incorporate student voice. For example, the Big Picture Learning model focuses on personalized learning and project-based curriculum, where each student designs and pursues their own interest areas. This has been shown to increase engagement and self-confidence in students and improve their academic performance. Another approach is the International Baccalaureate system, which allows students to select their own courses while still ensuring a broad and comprehensive education.

It is important to note that under such models, the role of a teacher shifts from a sage on the stage to a guide on the side. They become facilitators for learning, rather than dispensers of information. This shift in roles is essential to help students take ownership of their education and develop the skills necessary for lifelong learning.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both its pros and cons. While it has its benefits, there are also challenges that need to be addressed. However, a more student-led approach to education is becoming increasingly popular, and innovative models are emerging that incorporate student voice in the design of curriculum. These models have shown promising results in terms of increased engagement and academic success. As education continues to evolve in the 21st century, it only makes sense to involve the students themselves in the creation of their own learning experience.
