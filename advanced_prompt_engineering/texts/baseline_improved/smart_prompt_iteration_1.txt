As a student, have you ever wished that you could have more control over your high school curriculum? Or are you content with the status quo, where your education is decided by others? The topic of allowing students to curate their high school curriculums is a controversial one, with many arguments for and against it. In this essay, I will explore both sides of this debate and offer my personal perspective on the matter.

Traditionally, the high school curriculum has been structured in a way that follows the standards and guidelines set by officials and administrators. However, this approach may not be suitable for every student as every student has a unique way of learning. Therefore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can provide them with a better education tailored to their learning style. Students may choose the subjects they are interested in and avoid the ones that they find unappealing. By doing so, it can create a more personal and enjoyable educational experience for students. This approach may also lead to a higher level of student engagement that maximizes the effectiveness of the student's learning strategy and elevates their overall performance.

On the other hand, allowing students to curate their curriculums could lead to a situation where they miss out on essential subjects. For instance, students may choose to prioritize electives or subjects in which they excel and ignore the core subjects. This could lead to an unbalanced, incomplete education, which could have repercussions down the line for the students as they transition to college and beyond. Additionally, allowing students to curate their curriculums could create an excessively competitive environment where students tailor their curriculum to impress colleges or pursue future careers. This may not be healthy for the studentâ€™s mental wellbeing or the overall learning environment.

Furthermore, instituting student-led curriculums would entail reworking the entire education system, which could be overly complicated and time-consuming. Education professionals must consider a multitude of factors, such as teacher workload, financial resources and institution standards to ensure that every student receives a well-rounded education. It would involve a lot of assessment and research to create a system that is more tailored to students' individual needs while still meeting educational standards.

Despite the potential challenges, allowing students to curate their high school curriculums is an innovative approach worth consideration. Schools such as New York's Urban Assembly Maker Academy and Maine's Integrated Charter School already offer this approach and have seen an improvement in student engagement and test scores. Therefore, policymakers should be open to exploring different options if they believe it could potentially improve the education system for the better.

In my opinion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculums can be a step in the right direction. While the implementation may be complex, it has the potential to provide students with a more personalized and enjoyable educational experience that can improve their academic performance. However, there need to be certain standards that students should adhere to ensure that they receive a well-rounded education. It is vital that policymakers strike the right balance between individual student autonomy and the need to maintain overall educational standards.

To conclude, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? The answer is not straightforward. There are pros and cons to this approach. However, if implemented well and with careful consideration, it could lead to a better high school experience for students, which ultimately creates better learners and better citizens. It is absolutely possible for educators to work on a student-led curriculum that provides balance in curriculum content and equips students with essential knowledge and skills while still allowing them to choose subjects that interest them.
