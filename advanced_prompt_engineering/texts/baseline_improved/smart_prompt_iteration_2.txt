The education system has been long-awaited for a transformation that's more individually focused and less oriented towards rote learning. It's now becoming quite widely acknowledged that many students could benefit more greatly from a learning program personalized to their individual requirements and ambitions. As a student, reflecting on my experiences, I believe that high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum.

In most education systems, students have to cover a fixed set of subjects throughout their time in high school. Although this approach is logical to a certain extent, it may not always provide the most meaningful experience for students. One-size-does-not-fit-all in education, and students have drastically different aspiration levels, interests, and talents, meaning they need a customized curriculum.

Incorporating elective courses is one approach to tailoring the learning program to suit students' preferences. They are courses that students can pick up according to their interests, in addition to the standard set of primary subjects. For example, art, music, drama, and language courses would encourage students with creative ability to explore their talent. Moreover, supplemental courses like computer programming, entrepreneurship, or advanced mathematics could enable pupils with a special interest to explore further. Elective courses are a gateway to keep students impassioned and intrigued.

An additional approach to customize the curriculum is allowing students to choose particular topics to delve deeper into within a subject. For instance, in history class, an individual can examine more in-depth on the topic of the 'Civil Rights Movement.' Envision the excitement and involvement that would come from students if they got to pick their subjects and identify their own in-depth exploration of a subject.

Permitting students to personalize their curriculum would develop enhanced autonomy and responsibility. Taking control of their learning process would train pupils to set objectives and be motivated and accountable for their results. Moreover, it would permit students to establish and apply their conclusions and, in a more significant analysis, prepare them for college and professional schooling.

As a student, I am sure many of you must have encountered classrooms where students seem sleepy or out of energy, where students feel bored or overwhelmed. In contrast, there are classes where students look alert, interested, and actively participating. As people, we realize that we can contribute our best when we are enthusiastic about something. Thus, when students have the liberty to choose the classes of their curiosity, they would appear more engaged rather than disenhaloed. The liberty to customize academic courses would generate a more focused and successful learning environment.

However, some critics of customizable curriculums might increase that students may not be mature enough or might select classes which are less challenging and not as necessary. Yet, they overlook the fact that students come from a range of backgrounds, mental capabilities, and career aspirations, and the one-size-fits-all program doesn't cater to a vast range of students. Students are aware of the needed courses for college entry, and so someone might tailor their curriculum to be college-oriented. Furthermore, educators and advisors would have an opportunity to aid students in picking courses that would address these problems.

In conclusion, I believe that high school students should be allowed to curate their curriculum. Personalising education caters to students of different interests, talents, and skills, permitting them to discover their passions and develop as an individual. It moreover drives accountability and engagement, giving students a better chance of succeeding academically and in the real world. It's high time for schools to realize that every student is unique and to cater to their individual needs to create a more effective and engaging learning experience.
