Every school has its own standard curriculum that follows a certain guideline. However, there is a growing belief that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. The question is whether it is a good idea to let them do so? In this essay, I will put forth my opinion on this topic.

Firstly, some may argue that letting students have a say in what they learn may encourage them to take responsibility for their education. As a student myself, I must admit I am more invested in my studies when given the opportunity to choose. Surely, students know what interests or motivates them, and thus, should have some freedom in deciding what they learn. By steering their education towards their interests, students are likely to be more engaged, which could lead to better academic performance.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could also help cultivate skills that are not typically emphasized in a standard curriculum. Students may wish to advance their skills in the area of arts or sports. By honing their talent, students can build self-confidence, learn teamwork, and, in the end, benefit from life experiences beyond just academics.

However, critics might argue that students lack the level of expertise required to make informed decisions about their education. This is a valid point - students may not fully grasp the long-term implications of the courses they choose, and could end up neglecting key subjects that they will need later in life. Also, school boards and teachers could question their judgement in deciding their curriculum, as they are experts in the field.

Moreover, many schools might not be equipped to handle such curricular changes if every student requested them. Teachers could face immense pressure to teach courses that fall outside their area of expertise. This could pose a challenge to school administration who might find it challenging to recruit teachers with different skill sets to cater to such student’s demands.

In real life, some schools are already implementing such curricular programs. Stanford University provides its students the ‘Stanford Splash Program’. The program invites high school students to curate their course and curricular offerings like their college counterparts. Not only does this program follow the school standards but also helps the school build partnerships with future students it would like to see attend their school.

To conclude, an educational system can only be effective when students are deeply invested in it. Cooking up an attractive curriculum may help student’s graduate with enhanced skills. Based on my opinion, students do deserve a say in what they learn, but not at the expense of critical subjects that are crucial to their future. It is important for students to have some measure of control in their education, but it’s equally important to trust teachers who have the knowledge to guide academic development.  Learning should then become a shared responsibility between students, teachers, and school administration.
