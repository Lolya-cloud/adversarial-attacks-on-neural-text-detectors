The topic of whether or not students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum has been a contentious issue for a long time. This essay will examine both sides of the argument and present my personal view on the matter. 

On one hand, giving students the freedom to pick their courses would allow them to take greater ownership of their learning journey. By choosing classes that align with their interests and aspirations, students are more likely to remain driven and involved in their studies. Additionally, they will not be forced to attend classes that do not appeal to them, resulting in less dissatisfaction and better academic results. 

Furthermore, enabling students to shape their curriculum could aid teachers in tailoring educational solutions tailored to each student's unique needs and perspectives. For instance, a student who is struggling in a particular subject could take additional classes in that area to strengthen their learning foundation. By providing students with customized learning paths, they may learn at their own pace and benefit from tailored instruction at the same time.

On the other hand, those opposed to this method of academic planning contend that students may not have the knowledge or experience required to make informed decisions regarding their curriculum. As a result, they might end up taking courses that are not fundamental or beneficial to their future growth. There is also the risk that students could overlook necessary subjects, which could hinder their overall academic and employment prospects.

Nonetheless, whether or not students should be permitted to curate their high school curriculum is subject to a variety of factors. One such factor is the level of mentoring and guidance that is available to them. Advisers who are knowledgeable may be critical in this regard, providing students with insight into the various classes available and providing advice on career paths and prospective college majors.

In conclusion, the effectiveness of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is a matter of debate. Whether this approach to learning would be beneficial or problematic depends on many variables, such as the level of guidance given to students and their academic readiness. In principle, this measure has the potential to result in more involved and motivated students who are more passionate about their studies. However, there is a chance that they may miss out on key topics that are important for lifelong learning. To be successful, curriculum curation should be properly weighed, guided, and managed to ensure balanced learning that fosters lifelong learning and accomplishment.
