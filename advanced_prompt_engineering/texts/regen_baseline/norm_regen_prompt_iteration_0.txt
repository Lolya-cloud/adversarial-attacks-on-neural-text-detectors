In recent years, the idea of school students curating their high school curriculum has gained interest and sparked discussion within the education community. The current education system mandates a perpetually ongoing curriculum for all students. However, it is gradually being understood that students are better equipped to select courses that align with their interests and that suit their career aspirations. This essay discusses the topic of whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

At the core of the argument for allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is the idea that it would allow students to select courses they enjoy and find more interesting. When a student is allowed to study a subject they have invested interest in, they will be more involved, motivated and willing to learn. In that sense, academic progress would likely increase due to a boost in their interest towards their areas of study.

The idea of a personalized learning experience is another significant argument for allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. If given the opportunity, students can benefit from selecting courses that align with their needs and interests. This allows students to pick courses that are tailored for specific career paths and provide practical knowledge that is directly related to their chosen future profession.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would provide them with adequate practical skills relevant to their future career paths. Students will be able to learn more about real-world scenarios that they might face in their future professions. They can apply this knowledge to develop and create better solutions to problems when they embark on their chosen professions after graduation.

On the other hand, opponents of this view assert that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may increase the probability of them selecting courses that are less rigorous, thereby failing to gain a holistic education. Critics also argue that students are not well-equipped to choose since they may not have the necessary knowledge and foresight needed to see beyond the present. 

Some argue that the education system is designed to provide a structured curriculum aiding all students to attain at least a basic level of education. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would, therefore, make it arduous for schools to create a nationally acknowledged curriculum. Moreover, providing students with the power to curate their curriculum may result in issues relating to lack of coherence in the knowledge acquired.

To draw a conclusion, it is evident that there are advantages and disadvantages to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. While some argue that allowing students to have control over their courses, would result in incomplete and less rigorous education, there are more potential benefits to it. Ultimately, providing students with the opportunity to craft the curriculum that aligns with their aspirations is beneficial. It results in increased interest, motivation, and improved academic progress. It equips them with the skills, knowledge and, practical experience they require for successful careers. Allowing high school students to curate their curriculum should be given a more thoughtful consideration as it provides a conducive step towards individualized student-focused learning.
