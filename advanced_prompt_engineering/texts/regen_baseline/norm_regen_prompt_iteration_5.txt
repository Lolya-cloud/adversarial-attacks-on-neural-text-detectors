Education has played a significant role in human building civilization for centuries. As we continue to learn about what works best for different individuals in their academic journeys, the question arises - Should high school students curate their curriculum? This subject has sparked lively discussions, with proponents and opponents offering varying opinions. 

Supporters of allowing students to tailor their high school curriculum argue that it offers several benefits, such as enabling students to focus on areas of interest and passion. When they're passionate about their coursework, students will study and research topics thoroughly, gaining a deeper understanding of the subject matter. By earning more credits in classes they enjoy, students tend to perform better - gaining better grades and are more likely to remain engaged with school. This is essential as High School serves as a crucial period to set the stage for future academic pursuits.

Furthermore, having a selected curriculum that caters to their passion allows students to remain more motivated and interested in their learning. Tailored coursework permits students to plan their education path with a sense of agency and understanding of what they would like to study later. For instance, students who are interested in engineering or environmental science could enroll in specialized classes to immerse themselves in these areas to enhance their future career prospects. 

On the other hand, opponents argue that a curriculum designed by students could be detrimental to their overall development. They worry that students may focus solely on courses they deem easy or that they have a deep interest in, fear missing out on a more holistic education that gives a more diverse perspective. Critics have also raised concerns that by allowing students to pick their coursework, it could be a cause of division among students with varying interests and goals.

Despite opposing opinions, the advantages of allowing students to tailor their high school curriculum outweigh the potential drawbacks. This would provide students with a chance to pursue knowledge and passion in subject areas they love, helping them to gain a wider understanding of the world. It can also give them the motivation needed to work harder and pursue related careers after graduation.

To ensure students receive a well-rounded education, schools could require fundamental coursework in math, science, English, and social studies, leaving some room for student selection. The school system can also offer a broader range of electives that help cover areas of interest that students are passionate about, leading to a deeper understanding and even better grades.

Besides academic subjects, high schools can offer vocational courses, such as programming, mechanics, and other technical courses that function in line with the current job market trends. This will ensure that students possess practical skills that will help them pursue diverse career paths in the future. The idea here is that academic learning does not have to be separated from real-life applications.

In summary, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum presents a host of advantages that extend beyond traditional academic pursuits. It offers students the chance to learn and develop a passion for different fields, gain practical and useful skills, and chart their own academic journey. High schools should continue to adopt a flexible approach that allows students to venture beyond the standard curriculum to reach their fullest potential.
