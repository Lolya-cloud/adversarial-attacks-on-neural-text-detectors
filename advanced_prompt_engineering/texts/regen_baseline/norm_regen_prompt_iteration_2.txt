In today's fast-paced world, we are in a time of change. Similarly, the traditional schooling system no longer appeals to all students, who often find themselves bored and disinterested in the standard curriculum. As a result, some are advocating for the introduction of student-curated curricula in high school. In other words, students should be allowed to pick the subjects they wish to study in order to make their high school experience more meaningful, relevant, and enjoyable. 

Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can lead to positive learning outcomes. Firstly, it enables them to explore their passions, learn about their interests and areas they are passionate about. Such learning engagement provides them with a heightened motivation to succeed in their studies. It also empowers them to take ownership of their education, creating more organic learning. By allowing teenagers to curate their high school experience, they may become more likely to participate in extracurriculars, boosting their personal growth and academic success. 

Secondly, adapting the curriculum to each student's unique needs can foster a sense of responsibility and independence. Allowing high school students to select their favorite courses can develop better time and goal management skills intersecting with regular academic responsibilities. Curating the course list allows students to marginally discover themselves, challenging individual growth. This enables students to develop the ability to make informed choices, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. 

Thirdly, student-curated high school curricula promote a student-centric approach to learning. Different students have various learning styles. One-size-fits-all teaching may be a cause of disgeneration and boredom. Each student might have an easy time learning math, but English language arts might require special attention to their unique needs. . Adapting the curriculum to individual's interests and leaning styles, may open their minds to learning more both inside and outside of class. Such customising enables students to select courses with the most potential relevance to their future career aspirations at the same time, providing competencies relevant to their future careers.

However, against such an examination, some might argue that allowing high school students to pick and choose classes might lead them to neglect other fundamental areas of study. For instance, students might overlook essential courses like science or history in favor of electives. It's still important to mention that this argument is a bit invalid; when allowing students to curate their own courses, educators can provide students with a list of what classes are critical and required to graduate. This will help to ensure a well-rounded education and ensure student's importance.

In conclusion, delegates of the learning structure are now called upon, more than ever before, recognising that students can possess a diverse range of abilities, choices, and career aspirations in the future. The advent of customised education will facilitate more intuitive student learning. Indeed, the students will find their high school experience more engaging, which in turn boosts their motivation and engagement in their learning journey, pushing open doors for their career paths. We must ensure the core elements of the pupilâ€™s academic career are accomplished while challenging them with optional courses they personally find appealing. Curating the curriculum empowers students to take responsibility for their education, produce responsible citizens and who consider educational achievements as the interface between schooling and lifestyle. High schools across the nation must develop and support student-managed learning initiatives not only for teaching purposes but for personal growth.
