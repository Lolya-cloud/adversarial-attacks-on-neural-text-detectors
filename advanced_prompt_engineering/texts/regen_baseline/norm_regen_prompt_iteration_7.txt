In recent times, there has been much debate about whether school students should have the freedom to curate their high school curriculum or not. While a section of the society believes that students should have the liberty to choose what they want to study, others claim that a fixed curriculum ensures that they gain a comprehensive education. In my opinion, it is appropriate to allow high school students to curate their curriculum but with certain conditions.

To begin with, granting autonomy to students can give them a sense of ownership over their education. When students can choose the subjects they want to study, they become more involved in their education. They start taking an active interest in their studies and feel more responsible for their academic performance. Such an attitude can lead to better academic performance and involvement in the classroom.

Moreover, an individualized curriculum can also help prepare students better for their future careers. When students choose courses that align with their interests and ambitions, they are more likely to learn the skills and knowledge they need to excel in their selected field. This could contribute to higher job satisfaction and success in their careers. For instance, students wanting to pursue a career in engineering could choose to take advanced courses in math and science, while those wanting to take a humanities career path could focus on history and literature.

That said, it is crucial to ensure that allowing the students to curate their curriculum should not mean disregarding a comprehensive education. While students should be allowed to choose the subjects they want to study, there should be certain requirements in place to ensure that they receive a well-rounded education. This could involve mandatory courses in math, science, English, and social studies.

Furthermore, students must be provided guidance as they curate their high school curriculum. School counselors and teachers need to offer valuable guidance and support to guarantee that students make informed decisions about their course selections. The teachers could offer advice on which courses will be most advantageous by gauging individual strengths and interests.

Another area of concern has been the potential for inequality by allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Students from affluent backgrounds may have access to certain courses or resources that students from lower-income families may not, leading to an unfair playing field. To address such issues, schools should make a concerted effort to provide equal chances for all students to access the same courses and resources, irrespective of their socio-economic status.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has many benefits, but it should be done with caution and under certain conditions. Students should have the freedom to choose the courses they want to study, but there should be some mandatory requirements to ensure that they receive a comprehensive education. Guidance should be provided to students by counselors and teachers to ensure that informed decisions are being made, and measures should be in place to ensure equity. By giving students the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum, it could lead to better academic performances, increased career readiness, and a greater sense of responsibility towards their education.
