The topic of whether or not high school students should be allowed to curate their own curriculum has been a source of debate in recent years. While some individuals argue that students should have the freedom to choose their own courses, others contend that this could be detrimental to their future academic success. In this essay, we will explore both the advantages and disadvantages of allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum.

There are numerous benefits to allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum. One of the most significant advantages is that students are more likely to be engaged in their studies if they are interested in the courses they are taking. When students have a say in their education, they are more motivated to succeed, resulting in improved academic performance. Allowing students to choose the courses that interest them also provides an opportunity for them to develop a more in-depth understanding of a particular topic. Additionally, students with unique interests that may not be addressed in a traditional curriculum have the opportunity to explore these topics, broadening their horizons and increasing their knowledge base.

Another argument in favor of students selecting their own courses is that it allows them to tailor their education to their individual goals. By choosing specific courses that align with their future career aspirations, students can develop the skills needed to ensure future success. Furthermore, students who have more control over their education learn valuable self-reliance and independence skills that will serve them well in the future.

Despite these advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum. For instance, students may select courses that do not provide a well-rounded education or give enough attention to core subjects such as mathematics, English, and science. Additionally, students may be unaware of the prerequisites required to study certain courses, such as pre-calculus, which may hinder their academic progression. 

Another concern is the level of guidance available to students when making decisions about courses to take. While students have the freedom to pick classes as of their choice, there should be professionals available to provide advice and guidance to aid students in making sure they are making informed decisions that align with their career goals. As this would help them avoid taking classes that do not contribute towards their overall progress.

In conclusion, the issue of students curating their own high school curriculum is a hotly debated topic. While there are various advantages to granting students more control over their learning, ensuring they choose a well-rounded curriculum contributes towards their academic growth. Nonetheless, due to the potential consequences of allowing students to select courses that do not contribute towards a rounded education, guidance from educational experts should be made available to students. Consequently, it is essential for a balance to be struck in the design of high school curriculums, the decisions or choices offered must be sufficient and comprehensive enough to ensure students develop necessary academic skills while exploring subjects that interest them.
