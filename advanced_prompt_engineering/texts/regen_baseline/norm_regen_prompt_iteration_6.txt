Education is a vital aspect of every individual's life, as it equips us with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in our chosen career. School education builds a strong foundation for further studies, but students often feel that they lack control over their high school curriculum, which can limit their interests and career goals. This has sparked debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can lead to a more personalized learning experience. Every individual has a unique learning style and interests. Allowing them to select subjects that align with their passions ensures that they focus more on their interests, which can boost their confidence and encourage them to pursue their career goals. Moreover, personalized learning can reduce boredom and disengagement, which are major contributors to low academic performance.

Moreover, curating a high school curriculum enables students to focus on skills essential for their future. Many careers require specific skills, such as language proficiency, coding, and communication skills. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum provides an opportunity to focus on acquiring these skills, preparing them for their desired career paths. This is particularly beneficial for students who have specific career aspirations in mind.

Furthermore, giving students more control over their high school curriculum can enhance their engagement with the learning process. Choosing what they would like to learn increases their sense of ownership, responsibility, and accountability in their education. This can improve their motivation to learn and develop a love for learning, resulting in higher academic performance. Additionally, when students have a say in their courses, they are more likely to apply themselves and apply the acquired knowledge in their daily lives. 

However, some argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum would limit their exposure to various areas of knowledge, leading to a narrow education scope. This could limit academic knowledge and skills, making it challenging to adapt to the changing world and job market. However, this argument is based on the assumption that students will only concentrate on one or two subjects. In reality, students will consider more diverse courses, ensuring a balanced education.

Moreover, another concern is that students might choose courses that are relatively easy or conflict with their core subjects. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that students have access to counselors who can guide them in their course selections, ensuring they select courses that challenge them based on their interests and capabilities.

In conclusion, the idea of whether school students should curate their high school curriculum is a matter of controversy, with valid arguments on both sides. Nevertheless, allowing students to choose their courses can have a positive impact on their education, motivation, and success. The curriculum must be structured to enable students to make informed choices while receiving quality, well-rounded education. To ensure students are well-prepared for the future, the curriculum must enable them to acquire the essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue their desired career paths.
