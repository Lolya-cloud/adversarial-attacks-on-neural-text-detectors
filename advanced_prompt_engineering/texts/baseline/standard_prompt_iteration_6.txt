High school is a crucial time in a student's life where they are expected to make choices that will shape their future. One such important choice is the selection of subjects to study. In most countries, the high school curriculum is pre-determined, and students do not have much say in what they learn. However, there has been a growing call to allow high school students to curate their curriculum. This idea has sparked debates among educators, parents, and students, with arguments for and against. In this essay, I will explore both sides of this issue and provide my opinion.

One reason why students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is that it would lead to a more engaged and motivated student body. When students are given control over their education, they are more likely to be invested in their learning. This is because they are studying subjects that interest them and align with their career aspirations. In turn, students' motivation leads to better academic performance and higher retention rates. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that student motivation increases when they have control over their learning.

Another argument in favor of allowing students to curate their curriculum is that it would help them to explore more diverse areas of study. Traditional high school curriculums tend to gravitate towards standard subjects such as science, math, and English. However, students interested in pursuing unconventional careers such as art, creative writing, music, or dance might not find these subjects adequately represented in their curriculums. By giving students more control over their education, they can use this opportunity to explore different subjects and discover new interests.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could be argued as a means of supporting student autonomy, which enhances student self-direction, ownership, and accountability. By having a say in their education, students will develop the key skills necessary for being successful adults and leaders. This approach would encourage students to take responsibility for their academic progress and develop effective decision-making skills.

On the other hand, some argue that allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum could lead to inadequate preparation for higher education. Critics claim that students may lack essential knowledge in specific subject areas when left to aimlessly choose their curriculum. They may not have a sufficient understanding of what subjects or topics are essential for further study, leading to gaps in their foundational knowledge.

Another issue is that students may choose to learn purely based on their interests rather than aiming to gather a well-rounded education. This approach may lead to an unbalanced set of skills and a lack of knowledge in subjects that are fundamental to succeeding in higher education or the workplace.

In conclusion, while both sides have valid arguments, I believe that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will lead to a more motivated, engaged, and diverse student body. By offering a more personalized approach to education, students' individual passions would be explored and nurtured, leading to students who are more interested and committed to their learning. By providing students with an unregulated variety of subjects, educators would ensure that their students are well-rounded with essential knowledge, offering a fair blend of career-focused skills and broader personal development. 

Overall, incorporating student choice into high school curriculums would lead to innovative thinking and unique perspectives. It could be the key to shifting education to a more student-centered model that values the learner's needs and interests.
