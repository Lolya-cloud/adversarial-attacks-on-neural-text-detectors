The curriculum of high schools is a subject that has been debated for decades. There are various ways that the curriculum of a high school can be designed, and each method has its advantages and disadvantages. The question now arises, Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? There is no clear answer to this question because there are valid arguments for both allowing and not allowing high school students to curate their curriculum.

One advantage of letting high school students curate their curriculum is that it allows them to take responsibility for their academic paths. When students are given the power to choose what they want to study, they become more invested in their education. This, in turn, leads to better academic performance as they will be more motivated to learn what they have chosen. Additionally, students will have a higher degree of satisfaction in their education because it will be tailored to their choices, making them feel more in control of their lives.

Another advantage of letting high school students curate their curriculum is that it allows them to develop their interests. Many students feel as though they are forced into taking classes that they do not want to take. This can lead to disinterest and a lack of motivation in their education. By letting students choose their curriculum, they become more engaged in their education and can pursue their interests, which can, in turn, lead to a more productive and fulfilling academic experience.

However, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum has its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is that it may lead to a less comprehensive education. When students are in charge of their education, there is a risk that they may choose to study only their favorite subjects. This can lead to neglecting other subjects that are equally as important to their academic development. Additionally, students may lack the expertise to make decisions about their education. High school students do not have the same level of experience and knowledge as teachers, meaning that they may not be able to make informed decisions about what they should study.

Another disadvantage of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is that it might lead to a lack of uniformity. One of the primary functions of the high school curriculum is to provide students with a set of essential skills that they will need to succeed in both higher education and the workplace. If students are allowed to choose their courses, there may not be a consistent standard of knowledge that all students will acquire. This will make it difficult for colleges to assess the knowledge of prospective students accurately, leading to a lack of equal opportunities.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is a topic that is complicated, and there are varied perspectives to consider. While there are various advantages, such as increased motivation and interest, and a greater sense of ownership among students over their learning process, there are also potential drawbacks, such as a lack of uniformity and breadth of knowledge. Therefore, while it may be a worthwhile consideration, it is essential to undertake careful thought and deliberation before implementing such a system.
