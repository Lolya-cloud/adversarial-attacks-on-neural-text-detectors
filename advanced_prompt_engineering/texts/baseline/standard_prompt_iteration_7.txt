The education system has been the subject of debate for years, with many people expressing different opinions regarding the curriculum and how it is delivered. One of the controversial topics is whether school students should have a voice in the curation of their high school curriculum. Some advocates argue that it is essential to engage students in the learning process by giving them the flexibility to choose subjects that interest them while others argue that it could lead to students making poor decisions.

On the one hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can foster a sense of empowerment and inspire enthusiasm for learning. High school is a time when students should be actively encouraged to take ownership of their education and become more involved in the learning process. Allowing students to choose their classes can help them explore and develop their passions, which could lead to lifelong interests and even future careers. This approach may also increase the student's motivation and the sense of responsibility towards their studies, resulting in better academic performance.

Additionally, such a system could also allow students to tailor their courses according to their academic strengths and weaknesses. By choosing what subjects they want to study, students can create a well-rounded curriculum that is uniquely suited to their interests and goals. This could reduce the feeling of being forced to study something they may not be interested in, resulting in a more positive learning experience.

On the other hand, some argue that students may not have the experience or knowledge required to make the best decisions about their curriculum. High school is a time when students are still learning about themselves and their interests, making it challenging to know which courses are best suited to their needs. Students may also be influenced by peer pressure or making decisions based on popularity rather than practicality, which could negatively affect their future educational and career prospects.

Additionally, students may not have a complete understanding of the skills required for future careers which could cause them to overlook critical subjects that are needed to succeed. This could lead to them limiting their potential or missing out on the classes required to access the opportunities they want.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum is a debatable topic. While the idea of giving students a say is attractive, there are also valid concerns about the potential drawbacks. If implemented correctly, however, allowing students to curate their coursework could foster enthusiasm, motivation, and empowerment while also requiring students to take charge of their own learning. An effective approach would involve schools guiding students while still allowing them to have agency in the process to create a win-win situation that benefits all stakeholders.
