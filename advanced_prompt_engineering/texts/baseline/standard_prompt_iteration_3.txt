The idea of allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum has been a topic of debate among educators and parents for several years now. While some argue that it promotes student autonomy and engagement, others contend that it undermines the value of traditional academic subjects. This essay will examine the reasons for and against allowing high school students to curate their curriculum and conclude by presenting my opinion on the matter.

Advocates of student-led curriculum highlight that it can lead to increased student motivation and improve student outcomes. They say that allowing students to choose the subjects, electives, and projects that interest them can make them feel empowered and more invested in their education. According to a study conducted by the University of Michigan, students who have control over the subjects they study are more likely to achieve higher grades and develop increased engagement. Additionally, students who have more choice in their academic pursuits are more likely to develop a deep understanding of the subject matter and find personal applications for it.

Opponents argue against student-led curriculum by criticizing the idea that students lack the experience, knowledge, and comprehension to make informed decisions. Traditional courses such as math, science, and social studies are essential to the intellectual development of students and are needed to prepare them for higher education. Students need guidance to choose courses that prepare them for the real world and equip them with the necessary skills for future careers. They argue that students are too young and inexperienced to have a clear idea of what they want to study and that by letting them make choices that suit their interests, we risk them missing out on well-rounded education.

However, by taking a balanced approach, it is possible to marry the two perspectives. Student-led curriculum can be implemented to complement traditional subjects and enable students to explore in-depth those areas that interest them. It is possible to devise ways in which students can tailor their educational journey to cover the essential subjects and specialized areas that speak to their interests.

I support the idea of allowing high school students to curate their curriculum, but it should be done within the purview of academic advisors. Curriculum advisors can provide guidance to students, ensuring that their choices align with their academic and career goals. Advisors can help them identify areas they want to explore while ensuring that they are taking courses that broaden their horizons and help them prosper in the future.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is an idea that should not be dismissed right away. While the traditional school systems remain essential to prepare students for future careers, student-led curriculum aims to motivate students to work harder while enhancing their learning journey. By taking a balanced approach, schools can meet both these goals, ensuring that students get the best education possible. Curriculum advisors must support and work with the students by providing guidance and mentoring and helping them find a balance between their academic journey and personal interests. Ultimately, education must focus on empowering students, and allowing them to have a say in their academic pursuits is a step towards this direction.
