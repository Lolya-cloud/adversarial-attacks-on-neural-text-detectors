Education plays a significant role in shaping an individualâ€™s future and career prospects. Every student has different interests, strengths, and weaknesses. However, the current education system does not allow students to curate their high school curriculum according to their liking. It begs the question, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

There are several arguments in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Firstly, students will be more engaged in learning if they can choose the subjects they are passionate about. When high school students are allowed to create their curriculum, they will be able to explore their interests and take courses that meet their career aspirations. This approach will motivate students to show more interest in their coursework and be more active participants in their learning process.

Secondly, a tailored curriculum can prepare students better for their future. The education system needs to prepare students to excel in their future professions. Unfortunately, the current education system is more focused on teaching by numbers and does not address the overall needs of individual students. Allowing students to curate their curriculum will provide them with the skills they need for their future careers.

Lastly, a tailored curriculum can be crucial for a student's mental wellbeing. When students are forced to take courses that do not interest them, they may feel unhappy and discouraged. The current education system does not provide them with the necessary flexibility to explore their interests. When students are allowed to choose their subjects, they are more likely to enjoy their time in high school and be happier.

However, there are also arguments against allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. Firstly, not all students are capable of choosing their curriculum successfully. Some students may not be able to make appropriate curriculum selections and may end up taking classes that do not prepare them well for their future professions. This could result in poor performance in standardized tests and hinder their progress.

Secondly, not all courses can be offered to all students due to budget constraints. Schools have limited resources, and meeting the curriculum demands of every student come with significant administrative and financial costs. Allowing students to create their curriculum might require additional funds and resources that many schools cannot afford.

Lastly, curating one's curriculum might put more pressure on students, especially those who are unsure of what they want to study. High school is a challenging time for many students, and the pressure of making the right decisions about their curriculum may be too much for some students.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. The education system should adapt to meet the needs of individual students and provide the necessary support for this change. A tailored curriculum can better prepare students for their future professions, keep them engaged, and improve their overall mental wellbeing. It is the responsibility of the education system to provide students with the support and guidance they need to select courses that meet their individual career aspirations. However, ensuring that students make the right curriculum selections requires continuous review and supervision to ensure that they are adequately prepared for their future careers. Therefore, implementing a well-thought-out curriculum curation policy that considers the diverse talents, interests, and backgrounds of each student can revolutionize the education system and lead to better academic performance and career prospects.
