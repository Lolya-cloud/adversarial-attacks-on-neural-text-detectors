As the education system evolves, new and innovative approaches to learning have been introduced. Nevertheless, the traditional model of instruction still remains prevalent in most schools. In today's society, customization is valued, and therefore it is essential for students to be provided with the opportunity to personalize their curriculum. Allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum is highly beneficial and should be considered.

The first benefit of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it will allow students to create a learning experience that caters to their interests, strengths, and future career aspirations. Currently, high school curriculums are designed to prepare students for college, but not all students aspire to attend college. As a result, students who do not aspire to attend college are force-fed with an education system that may not align with their career aspirations. If students were allowed to curate their curriculum, they would be able to focus on subjects that are interesting and relevant to their future career.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum provides an avenue for practical learning. There is a significant disconnect between the curriculum taught in schools and the skills required in the workforce. Consequently, graduates tend to struggle with adapting to a work-life routine. If students are allowed to choose their curriculum, they will be able to have a hands-on experience on the subjects taught, increasing the relevance of their education.

Thirdly, students who have control over their learning tend to be more engaged in the learning process. Studies have shown that students who have a voice in their learning are more motivated and show better outcomes. Students who curate their high school curriculum feel more invested in their education and tend to take on more ownership in their education.

In addition to the above benefits, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum will create a culture of accountability. Students who personalize their learning experience are more accountable as they have a clear understanding of what they want to achieve. It provides students with the opportunity to delve deeply into their passions, motivates them to engage more deeply, and creates a sense of responsibility and ownership of their education.

However, it is essential to note that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is not without its drawbacks. One of the drawbacks is that students who are left to curate their curriculum may fail to acquire important concepts. Students may end up specializing too early in their education and miss out on important knowledge required in other areas. However, this can be avoided by providing students with counseling and guidance from their teachers and mentors.

Another disadvantage of allowing students to curate their curriculum is that students may opt to skip complicated subjects that are vital in their education. This can lead to students graduating with an incomplete education, limiting their opportunities in the future. However, with the right guidance, students can be made aware of the importance of completing all subjects required in their education.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum is a highly beneficial approach to education. It provides students with a personalized education experience that aligns with their career aspirations and promotes a culture of accountability and ownership. However, it is crucial to provide students with guidance and support to help them make informed decisions about their education. If implemented effectively, allowing students to curate their curriculum could revolutionize the education system and create a brighter future for students.
