In the current education system, students are often mandated with a pre-determined curriculum that they must follow, regardless of interests, learning style or future career aspirations. Should schools allow their students to take an active role in curating their high school curriculum? The answer to that question is yes, and there are several reasons why it could be beneficial.

Firstly, allowing students to choose their curriculum will create a sense of ownership over their education. This sense of ownership will lead to increased motivation and engagement from the students. When students have a say in what they learn, they are more likely to be invested in the process, leading to higher levels of academic achievement and personal growth.

Secondly, students have different learning styles and interests. Not all students enjoy the same subjects, and some may be more inclined towards technical subjects, while others may have an aptitude for the humanities. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, they will be able to choose subjects that interest them, making the learning process more exciting and engaging. Additionally, this approach will ensure that students learn skills that are relevant to their future careers, rather than just learning subjects that have been deemed important by the school system.

Thirdly, allowing students to curate their curriculum will foster independent thinking and decision-making skills. When students are involved in the process of choosing their curriculum, they will be required to evaluate their options, make informed decisions and take ownership of their choices. Such skills will serve them well in all areas of life, not just in their academic pursuits. By taking responsibility for their own learning, students will become more self-reliant and better prepared for the challenges of the future.

However, there are certain risks associated with allowing students to curate their high school curriculum. The first risk is that some students may choose subjects that are easy or fun, rather than challenging or necessary. Such an approach could cause a gap between skills developed during high school and those required to succeed in their future careers. Therefore, schools should set guidelines and provide counseling to students to help them make informed decisions.

The second risk is that schools may not have the resources to offer all the classes that students may want to choose. In such an instance, schools may have to offer online or remote classes to meet the demand. They can also encourage students to explore alternative learning opportunities such as internships, mentorships, or college courses.

Thirdly, some students may not have the exposure or insight required to make informed decisions about their curriculum. This is especially true for those who come from underserved or underprivileged backgrounds. Schools will need to provide counseling and support to students who may not have access to resources that would help them make informed decisions about their learning.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is a good idea, as long as it is implemented with care and caution. Such an approach will foster ownership, engagement, and self-reliance in students, which will serve them well in all areas of their lives. However, schools must provide guidance and support to ensure that students make informed decisions and that their choices are relevant to their future careers. Letting students play an active role in their education is the way forward, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we educate and prepare the leaders of tomorrow.
