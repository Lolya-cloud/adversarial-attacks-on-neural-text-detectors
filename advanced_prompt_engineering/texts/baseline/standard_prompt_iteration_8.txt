In the traditional sense, school curriculum usually comes from experts, educators, and government entities. Students just follow it. But, a modern approach is challenging that idea. Educationists are exploring a new concept where students can say what they want to learn, and then learn it. If we want students to be more involved and engaged, we should give them more control over their learning. With this in mind, the question arises, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

The answer is yes. Empowering young people in this way can lead to a range of positive outcomes, including a more personalized, relevant, and enjoyable school experience. Giving students the freedom to curate their own learning path can lead to enthusiastic participation, active engagement, and ownership of their learning. Moreover, for so long, students have been skipping classes, engaging in classroom vices, and dropping out of school. One major cause of this is the lack of interest they have in the academic programs provided by the institution. When they have autonomy over what they want to learn and how they want to learn, students will be more curious and motivated to create a meaningful and useful high school experience for themselves.

Furthermore, students are more aware of their interests and strengths than anyone. Not all students can excel in math or physics, but some may have innate talents and interests in writing, music, or arts. Allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help each student develop their unique talents and interests. This way of learning can be so much effective because it will create a real-world experience, where students can choose the subjects that matter to them. They can collaborate with like-minded kids, make networks, do creative tasks, and even work on projects serving their community. This is like an incubator of practical experience.

On the other hand, there are some reasons why some would oppose this idea. One reason is that it would be difficult to ensure that every student receives a well-rounded education. Putting students in control of their high school curriculum may make it more challenging to ensure that they complete a broad range of subjects. However, to negate that, schools can have a suggested syllabus, where students can refer to when they choose their learning path. This can make sure that each student gets educated about all the essential topics in each field.

Another issue that some may point out is that students may be more likely to choose easy or irrelevant subjects, rather than more challenging or useful ones. Again, to counteract this, teachers and counselors can be available to help guide students to choose challenging courses that will challenge them and help them grow, so that they can be successful in life.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. For starters, students are more likely to be inspired and motivated if they are engaged in activities that interest them. Moreover, when students get the opportunity to choose the subjects they want to learn, they will have a better grasp of making the right and practical choices. Even though there are some downsides to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, these can be overcome with guidance, encouragement, and careful consideration of the essential subjects that students should learn. The bottom line is that the benefits outweigh the problems. When schools adjust to a student-centered approach rather than just an academic-centered approach, we will create better and empathetic individuals who are better prepared for the future.
