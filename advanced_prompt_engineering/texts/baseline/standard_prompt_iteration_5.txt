Education is the key to success, and every student deserves a quality education that meets their needs. High school students, particularly those who are motivated, often feel limited by the traditional curriculum offered by schools. In recent times, there have been several debates over whether or not these students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. While this idea has its pros and cons, it is my belief that students' choices should matter and they should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Firstly, students who have the power to curate their high school curriculum can choose courses that align with their career goals and interests. For instance, if a student desires to go into engineering, they can choose science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses and tailor their curriculum to suit their career aspirations. Additionally, students who feel limited or unchallenged by the traditional curriculum often have the opportunity to pursue advanced courses that challenge them and develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Moreover, students who curate their high school curriculum would have the opportunity to create a schedule that suits their learning style. Most students learn differently, and having the chance to choose courses that cater to their learning needs would help eliminate the frustration that often comes with traditional classroom settings. For example, some students prefer online classes that allow them to learn at their pace and prefer using technology to enhance their learning experience.

However, critics argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to a decline in academic standards and promote academic laziness. They claim that students may choose easier classes or even skip essential courses required for their education and future career. However, this is not necessarily the case. Students who curate their high school curriculum are often motivated and take their education seriously.

Furthermore, it is essential to consider the role of educators in ensuring that students make the right choices when curating their high school curriculum. Teachers and guidance counsellors can play a vital role in providing students with the right information and guidance to make informed decisions that align with their abilities and aspirations.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can be a positive step towards providing quality education and ensuring that students are adequately prepared for their future. When students have the ability to choose courses that align with their career aspirations, learning style, and interests, they become more engaged and motivated to learn. It is essential to involve educators in the decision-making process, and students must be adequately guided to make informed choices. Therefore, schools should give students the power to curate their high school curriculum, and in doing so, they will contribute to their success and future career opportunities.
