As a student who has undergone the high school experience, I firmly believe that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. In today's world where everyone wants to be unique, individualizing the curriculum for each student is a pressing concern. Education is no longer a one-size-fits-all approach because each student has their unique learning style and requirements.

It's fair to say that students need to have a say in their education since itâ€™s all about them in the end. Schools often teach students subjects that are not relevant or of interest to them, leading to dissatisfaction and mental disengagement. It's the last thing you need when you're struggling with academic pressure. Moreover, when you're forced to learn subjects you're not interested in, you're more likely to submit to complacency and perform poorly in academics. Therefore, the question is not whether students should be allowed, but to what extent.

Allowing high school students to curate their curriculum would foster intrinsic motivation, a critical factor in determining academic success. When students choose their curriculum, they are more engaged in their learning, and their motivation levels are higher. It becomes a powerful catalyst that sets the student up for academic excellence and success. When students are engaged in learning, they are more attentive, remember the material better, and perform better in their exams. When students enjoy what they are learning, they are more passionate, curious, and eager to explore new ideas in that subject area.

Moreover, students are less likely to drop out of school if they have an active role in their education. A curriculum that offers variety and caters to the student's interests and passions would likely keep students engaged and enthusiastic about learning. With this method, students would have fewer reasons to be bored with school and less likely to drop out due to academic pressures.

The ability to curate their high school curriculum also teaches students about personal responsibility and accountability. When students have to make important academic choices, such as deciding on classes, it forces them to think critically. This skill carries into other aspects of life, such as decision-making and personal planning. Moreover, it can empower students to take control of their own lives, providing them with a sense of autonomy and helping them thrive in their academic and professional lives.

Another fundamental aspect is that curating the high school curriculum fosters creativity, an essential characteristic needed for success in the modern-day world. Students who are offered the chance to explore areas of their liking and develop independent programs of study often produce unconventional ideas and methods. It's not about the course content but the processes of research, thinking, and problem-solving that derives surprising outcomes. For example, Microsoft CEO, Bill Gates, dropped out of college because he wanted to pursue his interests in technology and programming. Today, he's revolutionized the tech industry with his innovative ideas and iconic products. His strong desire to learn and explore led him to his unique journey of success.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their curriculum is necessary in today's educational landscape. It's imperative that education systems recognize the evolving demands of the 21st century and the critical importance of providing students a sense of autonomy. Students can become more motivated, accountable, creative, and less likely to drop out of school. It's time to bring a much-needed reform in the education system, and the first step is to let students inspire their academic journey. As we look towards a new era of education, it's paramount to provide students the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum and pave the way for an impactful future.
