As a student, have you ever wished you could customize your high school curriculum? Maybe take more classes that interest you, or fewer classes that feel irrelevant to your future goals? Well, the idea of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum has been gaining traction in recent years. But, the question remains: should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? 

On the one hand, some may argue that the traditional high school curriculum has been around for ages and has produced successful graduates for generations. Why fix what isn’t broken? However, the world is rapidly changing, and the skills and knowledge required to succeed in the workforce are evolving too. It’s worth considering if the traditional curriculum can keep up with such changes, and if it's doing enough to prepare students for their chosen paths. 

On the other hand, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could foster a sense of ownership over their learning that is currently lacking in the traditional model. When students have a say in what they’re learning, they're more likely to be invested in the material. Not only will this increase engagement and motivation, but it could also lead to better academic performance. 

But what would it look like to have student-curated curriculums? Would we see students dropping core academic classes in favor of only taking courses that interest them? Not necessarily. By allowing students to have a say in their education, we could see a shift towards interdisciplinary courses that combine traditional core subjects with specialized topics. Additionally, students could be offered a wider range of elective classes to choose from, providing more opportunities to explore their interests. 

Furthermore, curating a high school curriculum could help prepare students for their desired post-secondary educational goals. For example, if a student knows they want to pursue a degree in engineering in college, they could focus their high school coursework on math and science classes that would prepare them for the program. By streamlining their education in this way, students would be better equipped to handle the demands of higher education. 

Of course, there are potential risks to consider when allowing students to curate their curriculum. Students may choose courses that are too easy or not challenging enough, or they may choose courses that offer little practical application in the real world. Additionally, students may not have a clear understanding of future career prospects and could end up limiting themselves by only taking classes that interest them in the moment. 

The key to making student-curated curriculums work would be to implement a system that allows for guidance and support. School counselors could work with students to help them choose courses that align with their goals or help fill in any potential gaps in their education. Additionally, schools could create opportunities for students to explore different career paths through internships, job shadowing, or guest speaker events. 

In the real world, there are already examples of schools experimenting with student-curated curriculums. For example, the San Diego Met High School requires students to complete internships as part of their curriculum and allows students to create individualized projects that combine academic subjects with real-world applications. Another example is the Big Picture Learning Network, which has a philosophy of student-centered learning that focuses on building relationships and connecting students to their passions. 

In conclusion, while there are both pros and cons to allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, it’s worth considering the benefits that come with providing a more personalized education. By empowering students to take ownership of their learning and choose courses that interest them, we may see increased engagement, improved academic performance, and better preparation for post-secondary education and the workforce.
