As a high school student, I have often pondered the idea of having more control over my curriculum. It's frustrating to be forced to study subjects that I have little interest in and no career aspirations towards. So, should school students be allowed to have a say in shaping their high school curriculum? In my opinion, the answer is a resounding yes, and in this essay, I will explore the reasons why.

Firstly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can greatly increase engagement levels. When we are passionate about a topic, we feel driven to explore it fully and learn as much as possible. By allowing us the freedom to choose the subjects that interest us most, we are more likely to enjoy and engage with them. As a result, our attention spans increase, and we are able to retain information better. To illustrate this point, let's take my own experience as an example. In my school, we have a mandatory course in French. However, I have always been more interested in Spanish. If I had been given a choice, I would have selected Spanish classes, which would have motivated me to learn and improve my skills.

Another benefit of student-led curriculum development is that it encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When given the responsibility of choosing which courses to take, we must evaluate the pros and cons of each decision carefully. Through such critical analysis, we develop problem-solving skills that we can use in various areas of life. Being able to make informed decisions about our education and future is a crucial life skill that we can take with us into college and beyond.

However, we must also consider the potential negative impacts that student-led curriculum development may have. For instance, students may be tempted to choose easier courses over more challenging ones to ensure their graduation. They may also lack guidance on how to choose the best courses to meet their future career goals. Furthermore, without some form of oversight, students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be at a disadvantage when choosing their courses.

Notwithstanding, the benefits of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Through this approach, we can tailor our education to meet our individual needs, strengths, and interests while developing critical thinking skills. We can also prepare ourselves for future career paths, increasing our chances of success. Moreover, it allows us to take ownership of our education and gives us a sense of responsibility. 

Real-world examples support the assertion that student-led curriculums lead to higher success rates. For instance, countries with personalized education such as Finland and Singapore have ranked higher in overall education standards for years compared to the United States, which utilizes a one-size-fits-all approach. Singapore, for example, has a flexible curriculum that allows students to choose elective courses from other streams. As a result, students can create a curriculum that meets their interests and aptitudes. Similarly, Finland's individualized learning approach focuses on the individual needs of each student, leading to better academic outcomes.

In conclusion, allowing high school students to curate their own curriculum is an innovative approach that should be adopted by schools worldwide. It is a solution that helps students feel more engaged with their education, develop critical thinking skills and prepare them for a successful career.

As high school students, we are the future of our country and world, and having a say in our education can significantly impact our development and the world we inherit.
