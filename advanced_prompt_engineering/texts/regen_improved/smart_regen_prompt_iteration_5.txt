As an AI language model, I don't have personal reflections. However, I can provide an unbiased perspective on the topic of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the most debated topics in education is whether students should have the power to choose their own curriculum. The question arises from the notion of whether we should trust students' judgment in determining the best courses to pursue in high school. While some people may argue that the traditional education system, which is based on predetermined subjects, can serve students better, others support the idea of a student-led curriculum, which can empower students to take ownership of their academic journey.

In this regard, the question to ask is, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? The answer may not be as straightforward as it seems. However, what is clear is that there are several benefits to allowing students to take control of their curriculum. Let us examine these benefits.

Firstly, students have different strengths and interests, and allowing them to choose their curriculum can help them develop their potential. For instance, a music enthusiast may want to pursue music composition and performance, while a science enthusiast may prefer to take up biology, chemistry, and physics. The traditional education curriculum may not cater to everyone's interests, and students may lose motivation and direction if they are forced to pursue subjects they are not passionate about. But if students had the power to curate their coursework, they would choose subjects based on their strengths and interests. This way, they can explore their talents fully and have a better chance to excel in their chosen fields of study.

Secondly, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help them develop valuable decision-making skills. High school students are on the verge of young adulthood, and it is essential to encourage them to develop their decision-making abilities. If students were given the freedom to choose their studies, they would develop a sense of responsibility towards their education journey and take ownership of their academic achievements. By curating their coursework, students learn to become more independent, self-aware, and responsible individuals.

Thirdly, student-led curriculums can foster innovation and creativity. By allowing students to choose the subjects they are interested in, they get the opportunity to explore new fields and develop unconventional ideas. They can come up with new fields of study that address real-world problems and trends and propose innovative solutions that can shape the future. For example, students may choose to study sustainable development in their curriculum, which can lead to the creation of innovative ideas that can help address climate change challenges.

According to a 2018 study by the National Education Association, student-led curriculums can have a positive impact on academic performance. The study found that students who were involved in the curriculum development process showed increased engagement, motivation, and a deeper understanding of the concepts they covered. Additionally, such curriculums helped students develop essential skills such as critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can have many benefits for their academic and personal development. It can help them explore their interests and strengths, develop their decision-making abilities, and foster creativity. While predetermined subjects may provide a foundation for learning, giving students the opportunity to choose their concentration areas can personalize and enhance the learning experience. By allowing students to curate their coursework, we can develop well-rounded students who are better equipped to succeed in the real world.
