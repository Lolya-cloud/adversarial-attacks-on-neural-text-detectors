Education is one of the most valuable assets one can have in life. It is said that education can never be taken away from you and that it is the foundation upon which you can build your future. However, the traditional education system might not be the best fit for all students. As students advance through high school, their interests and ambitions start to diverge. Therefore, the question arises, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? 

On the surface, there are compelling arguments on both sides of the spectrum. Those against the idea argue that a standardized curriculum, focusing on standardized core subjects, is the best way to offer a well-rounded education to students. They claim that having mandatory classes in subjects such as mathematics, science, English, and social studies ensures that students receive a comprehensive education that will serve them well in college and beyond. 

However, those in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that a more personalized approach is required to ensure the best possible outcome for every student. A tailored curriculum can inspire curiosity and make learning more enjoyable, producing better results and preparing students more effectively for their future academic and career paths. It is often said that one size does not fit all, and education should be no exception.

In my experience, education works best when students feel engaged, inspired, and empowered. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be the most effective way to achieve this. It is crucial that students have a say in what they choose to learn, as they are the ones who will be spending years studying and preparing for their future. It is only logical that they choose the subjects and areas of study they care about the most, as it would likely result in higher levels of learning and a greater chance of success.

One crucial aspect to consider is that not all students are the same. Some students thrive in Math and Science, while others excel in the humanities or arts. With an opportunity to curate their high school curriculum, students can select classes that better suit their interests, aspirations and future goals. This flexibility would enable students to explore various areas of study, participate in classes they would otherwise not have the opportunity to explore, and discover new interests they may never have considered before.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can bridge the gap between those who are struggling academically. By offering personalized learning environments, students, especially those with different learning needs, can receive tailored education that meets their interests, abilities, and learning strengths, ensuring better overall student engagement. 

One example of this is the “Small Schools” movement started in the early 2000s in New York City. The initiative was designed to create more personalized, smaller learning environments for students instead of large and impersonal high schools. This idea would help to provide a more tailored education for students, with a focus on more practical and applicable real-world skills necessary for a successful career.

In conclusion, traditional education must be changed, as the world is rapidly evolving and students need to be as well-prepared as possible for their future. By allowing students to curate their high school curriculum, it would ensure a more personalized and effective educational experience. It is important to note that students should work in consultation with academic administrators and educators to ensure that they are creating reputable, functional, and helpful curriculums that will help them reach their career goals and aspirations. The education system should be designed to provide students with a comprehensive learning experience that prepares them not only for college but also for a successful career and life beyond the classroom walls.
