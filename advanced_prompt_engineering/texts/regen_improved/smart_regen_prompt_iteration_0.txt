Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? This has been a topic of debate for years, with opinions ranging from "yes" to "no" and everything in between. As a student who has gone through the traditional education system, I believe that students should have the autonomy to curate their high school curriculum. 

Firstly, allowing students to curate their curriculum can lead to increased engagement and motivation in the learning process. When students are given the opportunity to choose the subjects they want to study, they are more likely to be invested in their education. Teachers can then prepare course materials and assessments that are tailored to the student's interests, making the learning experience fun and engaging. This generates excitement and motivation to learn, creating a positive feedback loop that can profoundly impact a student's educational journey.

Moreover, empowering students to curate their curriculum can help teachers and schools tailor the program to meet the needs of a more diverse range of learners. Acknowledging that students have different learning styles, interests, and abilities means that the one-size-fits-all traditional curriculum no longer works. By providing an opportunity for students to input into course selection, educators can tailor learning paths that take into account different preferences and needs and cater to a broader range of students.

However, one primary worry that educators have about student control over curating their education is that students may not have the experience or knowledge to make informed decisions about what they want to study. This is a reasonable concern; after all, students still have a lot to learn, and they may not understand the full impact of their decisions on their future. However, this does not mean that we should limit the opportunities for student involvement entirely. Guidance from educators in the decision-making process can help students make more informed choices about what subjects they want to pursue.

In addition, another concern is that students may gravitate towards subjects that are less essential to their future careers or futures, which can limit their opportunities once they graduate. For instance, a student may opt to take fine arts classes for four years instead of mathematics, science, and other subjects considered important for tertiary education in STEM majors. Still, this does not mean that art or other less 'fundamental' subjects should not be included in the curriculum. It just means that education should strike a balance between the subjects that interest students and those that are critically relevant to their future careers or pursuits.

Many education systems around the world have already adopted the practice of allowing students to curate their curriculum. For example, in Finland, a country known for its high ranking in education worldwide, students can choose their high school curriculum independently with some guidance from the teacher to ensure that they take a balanced set of courses. This shows that students can handle the responsibility and make informed decisions about their learning pathways. 

In conclusion, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum to some extent because student autonomy in the education process promotes engagement, motivation, and often leads to more individualized learning paths. However, providing guidance in decision-making is necessary because students may not have all the experience and knowledge required. Additionally, striking a balance between subjects that interest students and those that are critical to their futures is important in crafting an effective, well-rounded education plan. It is high time we started exploring more ways to incorporate student involvement in education to create happier, more engaged, and more successful individuals.
