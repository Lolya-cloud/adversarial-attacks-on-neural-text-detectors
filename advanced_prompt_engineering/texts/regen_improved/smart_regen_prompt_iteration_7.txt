As someone who has been through the high school education system, I can attest to the challenges that come with a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching. Sitting in classes where I had no interest or passion made it challenging to stay engaged and learn to my fullest potential. I'm sure many students can relate to this sentiment. Still, the question remains, should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

The traditional education system emphasizes the importance of acquiring knowledge across a broad range of subjects. However, this approach may not benefit all students equally. Some may have interests in fields that go beyond the prescribed curriculum while others may find certain subjects challenging and need additional support or a different approach. Allowing students to curate their curriculum could help mitigate these challenges.

With that said, there may be some tensions arising from the nature of this approach. One major concern would be the credibility of such a program. Students could choose subjects that are not as academically rigorous, leaving them with gaps in their learning or defects when it comes to matters of skills acquisition. There could also be cases where students may not be challenged to learn more since they may focus on narrow areas of interest. However, when educators are committed to making this work, they could work with students to tailor their curriculum to ensure a healthy balance between academic rigor and student interest.

Many students receive their high school diplomas without knowing their career path or the skills they need beyond the classroom. Allowing them to personalize their education can help them hone the skills that they will need to thrive outside of school. For example, students who are interested in pursuing a career in the arts may choose to take additional courses in music, drama, or visual art beyond the core curriculum. Alternatively, students could use this approach to explore different fields, such as coding, business, or engineering.

It is not uncommon for students in their twenties and thirties to find their chosen careers in fields that did not exist during their high school years. This only goes to show how much the professional world is shifting. By allowing high school students to guide their learning journeys by creating their curriculum, education systems can help them stay flexible and adaptable to new technologies and industries. Consequently, they will be better prepared for whatever the future holds, and they will have the creative and critical thinking skills to navigate their career paths effectively.

The benefits of a tailor-made education approach do not stop at education alone. It also has the potential to help teachers redefine their roles. Instead of being strict preservers of a uniform education curriculum, teachers could act as co-learners with their students and work symbiotically with students to create constructive learning environments. With personalized learning, teachers can give students the flexibility for a more hands-on learning experience, teach to the students' strengths, and provide targeted feedback as needed.

In conclusion, students should have a say in their high school education. As a former student myself, I can confirm that the one-size-fits-all system can hinder a student's ability to learn to their fullest potential. A personalized curriculum approach gives students the flexibility to pursue their passions and strengthen their skills beyond the syllabus. Despite the challenges that may arise, a well-designed tailored-learning plan that balances academic rigor with relevant interests, goals and skills can benefit both students and educators. Ultimately, the goal of a tailored curriculum should remain centered on the needs and well-being of the student and their ability to learn.
