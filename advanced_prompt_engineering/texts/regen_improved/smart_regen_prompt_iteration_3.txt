As a former high-school student, I firmly believe that schools should allow students to curate their high school curriculums. The shift in the education landscape has shown that innovation and creativity are essential for academic success. Allowing learners to take an active role in choosing their courses has numerous benefits that extend beyond the classroom.

Firstly, curating their high school curriculum would enable students to learn in a way that matches their interests, abilities, and learning style. For instance, some students are great with numbers and logic, but they might not have an interest in history or literature. Allowing them to choose courses that cater to their interests could boost their engagement, academic performance, and overall satisfaction with the curriculum.

Secondly, it would encourage students to take ownership of their education, and improve their sense of autonomy and self-efficacy. This is especially important in the digital age, where there is an abundance of resources for learning that can be accessed outside the classroom. By giving students the freedom to curate their courses, we are in essence passing the torch of learning to them, empowering them to take charge of their education.

But, some might argue that student-selected curriculums could compromise the quality of education. That's where the role of experts comes in. There should be guidance and monitoring from advisors, ensuring that the students' choices align with the educational standards and requirements. One suggestion could be to incorporate student-selected courses into the core curriculum, creating a framework that meets both the educational regulations and the individual's interests.

On the flip side, without proper guidance and support, students could also opt for frivolous courses with no academic value. It would be a waste of resources, time, and detriments overall learning progress. Additionally, some less academically inclined students could choose to take courses that aren't challenging enough, leading to stagnation in their academic progression. Thus, effective monitoring, guidance, and support are critical for building sustainable student-selected curriculums.

In some parts of the world, innovative educational policies focused on student-selected curriculums have already been implemented, with remarkable results. For instance, in the Netherlands and Sweden, schools offer a wide range of electives that cater to student interests. Similarly, in Finland, a country famous for its innovative educational system, students have a say in their curriculum from an early age.

What's more, student-selected curriculums offer opportunities to introduce unique experiences into the academic environment. For instance, offering music production or graphic design classes could nurture a new generation of creative minds. Such classes would also prepare students for industries where creativity and innovation are crucial made successful. Equipping them with skills that are not included in the traditional academic mould.

Finally, the current education system aims to create well-rounded individuals, considering that each student has unique talents and interests. Student-selected curricula would allow learners to showcase their abilities and explore their strengths and weaknesses. It would nurture individualism, independence and self-awareness while increasing unique student outcomes of the graduated student pool. 

In conclusion, it's hard to overstate the importance of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculums. While there are potential drawbacks to this approach, the benefits are abundant. From personalized learning experiences to improved motivation, student-selected curricula pave the way for academic success and better-rounded individuals. It's high time that we explore ways to include learners' preferences and interests to improve educational outcomes for everyone.
