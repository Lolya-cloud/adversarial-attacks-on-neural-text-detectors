As an AI language model, I do not have personal feelings about art nor have I ever seen art. 

However, here is a possible formal five-hundred-word descriptive essay on the topic 'The most interesting piece of art I have ever seen':

The most interesting piece of art I have ever seen is a painting titled "Starry Night" by Vincent Van Gogh. This masterpiece captured my attention and held it tightly as I stood before it for what seemed like hours. The painting is an oil on canvas creation measuring 73 cm x 92 cm, depicting a tumultuous yet intriguing night sky of swirling blues, yellows, and whites illuminated by stars.

Van Gogh painted "Starry Night" in 1889 when he was a resident of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum, located in Saint-Remy de Provence, France. The painting is a combination of imagination and reality. The background is inspired by the view from his window at the asylum while the foreground is his creation.

Upon close inspection, the painting evokes an emotional response that is difficult to articulate. The sky seems to be in chaos, yet there is harmony in the brushstrokes. The stars twinkle and seem to be alive, thanks to the use of impasto- a technique that involves applying thick, textured layers of paint that create depth and movement.

The painting is rich in symbolism, with each element representing something. The cypress tree on the left has always caught my eye, with its spiky leaves and thick trunk, stands tall against the sky. It is believed to represent death, as it was often planted in cemeteries. Yet, in this painting, it seems alive and deeply rooted in the earth. This contrast makes the painting even more intriguing.

The village in the foreground also carries symbolism. The curving lines of the buildings and the wind reflect the artist's own struggle with mental health and instability. In contrast to this, the bright golden windows of the village seem to glow with warmth and comfort, signifying hope and light amidst darkness.

The painting's technique is also revolutionary. Van Gogh uses bold color choices and brushwork to express emotions powerfully. The swirling sky represents turbulent emotions, the cypress tree- death, and the village- hope. Everything is in motion, yet the painting creates an impression of stillness thanks to the artist's skillful manipulation of form and color.

In conclusion, "Starry Night" is an artwork that left me deeply impressed. It is much more than a mere painting- it is a masterpiece that embodies an artist's struggle while appealing to our deepest emotions. The symbolism, the rich colors, and brushstrokes are evidence of Van Gogh's genius. It is not hard to see why it remains one of the most famous paintings in the world.
