Cartoons have become a ubiquitous feature in the lives of children across the globe, with a wide range of programming available on television and online. While many cartoons are entertaining and educational, there is a growing concern about the effects of violent cartoons on children. This research essay will explore the relationship between violent cartoons and children, outlining the negative impacts that excessive exposure to violence in cartoons can have on children's behaviour and cognitive development.

Cartoons are widely accepted as tools for entertainment and education for children. However, violent cartoons portray aggression and hostility which can lead to aggressive and violent behaviour in children. The portrayal of violence in cartoons conveys inappropriate values such as aggressive behaviour in solving conflict situations. As young personalities develop, they require guidance to distinguish between positive and negative behaviours and emotions, and violent cartoons can lead to aggressive behaviour.

A significant disadvantage of violent cartoons on children is the normalization of violence. Over the years of watching violent cartoons, children begin to normalize violent behaviour and, as a result, become desensitized to violence. Studies show that over time, children exposed to violent cartoons tend to become more aggressive and less empathetic. They lose sight of the harmful consequences of violence and begin to view such acts as normal behaviour, which can lead to them being more accepting of violence in society.

Another negative impact of violent cartoons is that they can reduce children's emotional competence. While violent cartoons may seem like harmless entertainment, they can have a psychologically damaging effect on children. Cartoon violence often portrays characters tackling problems using aggressive means, which can make children think that's how to solve real-life issues. This approach affects character development, leading to maladaptive skills, and attitudes that affect children's long-term emotional competence.

Finally, the effects of violent cartoons on the cognitive development of children are noteworthy. Intense exposure to such programming may affect childrenâ€™s problem-solving ability. Instead, they employ aggressive behaviour to find solutions to problems, with research showing that this behaviour tends to be less effective. Furthermore, violent cartoons can impact learning capability, leading to poor academic performance in children.

In conclusion, violent cartoons have significant negative impacts on children's cognitive and behavioural development. They can affect children's emotional competence, increase violent behaviour and may stunt problem-solving ability by desensitizing children to violence. The media industry has a responsibility to ensure that children are not exposed to violent cartoons and that programming appropriate for their age and cognitive development is available. Parents also need to play an essential role in regulating the type of programming their children are exposed to, as part of their responsibility for their overall moral and character development. It remains imperative that policies are put in place by governments across the globe to ensure that children are not exposed to violent cartoons which can harm their psychological and cognitive development.
