In recent years, there has been a growing demand for universities to provide accommodations to disabled students. The issue has become particularly important as universities have increasingly recognized that disabled students face a range of challenges when it comes to accessing education. In this essay, we will explore the arguments for and against universities providing accommodations to disabled students. We will conclude by arguing that such accommodations are necessary for universities to fulfill their responsibilities as educators.

On the one hand, some argue that universities should not be required to provide accommodations to students with disabilities. They argue that doing so would be too costly and would place an undue burden on universities. Additionally, they suggest that some disabled students do not require accommodations in order to be successful in their studies, and that providing accommodations would be unfair to other students who do not receive them.

However, these arguments do not hold up to scrutiny. First, the cost of providing accommodations is not as high as some might imagine. Many accommodations can be made relatively inexpensively, and some costs can be offset by government grants and external funding. Moreover, universities have a moral and legal obligation to provide equal access to education to all students, regardless of their disability status. This is not only a matter of fairness but also one of legal compliance.

Second, there is strong empirical evidence to suggest that accommodations are beneficial to disabled students. Studies have shown that students who receive accommodations perform better academically, have increased confidence in their abilities, and are more likely to persist in their studies. In this sense, providing accommodations to disabled students not only furthers the goal of equal access to education but also promotes academic success more broadly.

Finally, universities have a responsibility to ensure that they are not only educating their students but also preparing them for the workforce. This means that universities must take into account the challenges that disabled students may face in the workforce and provide them with the skills and resources they need to succeed. Accommodations in the university setting can help to level the playing field and ensure that disabled students are not unfairly disadvantaged in the job market.

In conclusion, the arguments for and against universities providing accommodations to disabled students are complex. While there are some who argue that it would be too costly or unfair to provide such accommodations, these arguments do not hold up to scrutiny. Universities have a legal and moral obligation to ensure that all students have equal access to education, and providing accommodations is an essential part of this. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that providing accommodations can lead to increased academic success, confidence, and persistence. Finally, universities have a responsibility to prepare all students for the workforce, and providing accommodations is an important part of this preparation. For these reasons, we argue that universities should provide accommodations to disabled students.
