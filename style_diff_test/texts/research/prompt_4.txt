Preschool education plays a crucial role in shaping the future of a child. Given that, the efficacy of the preschool system thus becomes a relevant topic of discussion, and has been studied in detail in the past. Particularly, the question of whether children who attended preschool performed better in school than those who did not is debated. This essay argues that a preschool education is beneficial for a child's academic success.

The first reason that supports this argument is that preschool enhances a child's cognitive development. Pre-K programs offer interactive learning opportunities, such as puzzles, color matching games, counting exercises, as well as story time, that make children inquisitive and encourage them to learn. The environment promotes cognitive skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making by creating a challenging and supportive environment for children. According to a study conducted in 2013 by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), children who attended high-quality preschool showed better language, cognitive, and social-emotional skills than children who did not.

The second reason why preschool benefits children academically is that it reinforces social-emotional skills. Through interactions with teachers and peers, children learn necessary social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. Such skills are critical in enabling children to cooperate in a group and enhance their chances of academic success throughout their lives. According to the same NIEER study, preschool graduates outperformed their non-preschool peers in early elementary school for both math and reading scores, indicating that social-emotional learning acquired in preschool had a positive impact on children's academic performance.

Finally, preschool education puts children on a faster track to developing academic skills than their non-preschool peers, thereby providing a sound foundation for primary education. During a child's first five years, which is the critical window for brain development, preschool offers an opportunity to learn words, develop vocabulary, and rise to proficiency in reading and math. Studies have shown that children who attend preschool programs are better prepared to handle the rigorous curriculum of primary school than those who didn't attend. A study conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences in 2017, found that children in preschool programs had developed foundational skills in literacy, language, and math by the time they enrolled in kindergarten, and were already well above the children who did not have a preschool education.

In conclusion, evidence suggests that preschool education is a predictor of academic success for children. Pre-K education fosters cognitive and social-emotional development, which in turn, accelerates academic growth and provides children a sound foundation for primary education. As the findings suggest, giving children access to a high-quality preschool program, alongside continued literacy and math support, has the potential to bridge current achievement gaps in primary education. The benefits are numerous for both immediate and long-term academic success, social-emotional learning, and personal growth. Therefore, investing in preschool education is worthwhile for the future of academic success and personal growth for children and society.
