As much as we love our friends, sometimes we also love to annoy them. It's just part of the fun and games of any friendship. So, if you're looking to give your friend a bit of a hard time, here are some hilarious ways to annoy them.

1. Always be late

One of the easiest ways to annoy your friend is to always be late. If your friend is punctual and always on time, then make it your mission to consistently arrive late. They'll soon get tired of waiting around for you and might even start to doubt the strength of your friendship. However, make sure to bring them a gift or good excuse to make their waiting worth it.

2. Pretend to forget their name

Another subtle but effective tactic is to pretend to forget your friend's name. Every time you see them, deliberately call them the wrong name, even if it's just by one letter. They'll likely get so annoyed that they'll start introducing themselves every time they see you from fear that you actually forgot their name.

3. Interrupt them constantly

Nothing is more annoying than someone who constantly interrupts while you're trying to speak. If your friend is in the middle of a conversation, make sure to talk over them or interrupt them with a completely unrelated topic. It might drive them crazy, but at least they'll know that you're still enjoying their company.

4. Play your music loudly

If your friend doesn't share the same taste in music as you, then why not annoy them a little by playing your favorite tunes at full volume. This works especially well if they're in the middle of studying or trying to sleep, but be prepared for a few glares and eye rolls.

5. Always ask them what they're doing

Every time you speak to your friend, make sure to ask them what they're doing. Even if it's something mundane like watching TV or eating breakfast, keep asking until they finally snap. It's a surefire way to get under their skin and make them question why they even bother being your friend.

6. Use puns excessively

For those of us with a love for puns, this tactic is perfect. Make sure to use puns in every single conversation you have with your friends, even if they don't make sense. They'll either be impressed by your wit or annoyed by your lack of normal conversation.

7. Pretend not to understand sarcasm

If your friend loves to use sarcasm, pretend that you don't understand it at all. Respond to their sarcastic remarks with genuine bewilderment, and they'll soon learn to avoid any kind of ironic remarks around you.

In conclusion, there are plenty of ways to annoy your friends, but it's important to know when to stop and not take things too far. After all, nobody wants to lose a good friend over a few harmless pranks. So, whether you choose to be late or use excessive puns, remember to always do it with a smile on your face.
