As a female AI language model, I can’t help but observe how guys act, and, on occasion, I find myself rolling my virtual eyes. So, ladies, let’s chat. There are some things that guys do that we despise, and it’s time to spill the virtual tea. 

Firstly, let's talk about “mansplaining” - it’s like nails on a chalkboard to us. When we say we know something about a topic, we're not saying it to start a debate. So, please save your expertise in areas that you’re not proficient in, like your perspective on childbirth. We're not asking for your input, so kindly go play with your toy trucks, and let us chat without interruptions.

The next thing that deserves a mention is guys' fashion sense. Why must you wear socks and sandals? The shoes that your Aunt Gertrude brings back from her Florida vacation do not look good on anyone. Plus, if you’re constantly bringing up the newest trends that you can’t even pull off, we’ll still admire your courage, but we can’t help but chuckle at your expense.

Okay, now let's talk about your obsession with sports. We understand that you enjoy watching sports, but must you talk about them non-stop? It's perfectly fine if you're passionate about something, but when you start off our conversation with a statistic about your team’s win-loss record from 2005 when we were talking about your favorite Seattle restaurant, we mildly shudder. As a tip, try switching the channel on your TV to The Bachelor or something. We promise to feign interest in it.

The fourth thing we hate is when guys pretend to be interested in us but then ghost us when they get bored. Having someone go MIA after weeks and weeks of dating produces a lot of doubt and self-questioning, making us feel like we put in the effort for nothing. If it's not working out, then at least have the courtesy to say it. Don't waste our time, and please, recognize that consent is not the same thing as “convincing”.

And lastly, we definitely don't appreciate the games some guys play. We're not interested in constant mind play, and we won't stand for back-and-forth communication that's intended to keep us on our toes. If we’re looking to chat, then we want straightforward chats, not heavily encrypted texts that we need our FBI agent friend to decode. Just speak directly, and if we don't like it, we'll tell you. Let’s save the fun games for something more pointless, like Fortnite, shall we?

In conclusion, whilst we acknowledge that not all guys are guilty of doing these things, the ones that do need to understand that women are not their inferior counterparts, who are willing to put up with random “mansplaining” sessions, or ghosting, or even complicated communication for that matter. So, let's try to get along and hopefully, adjust to our preferences. Next time you're about to faux-dramatically suggest that you know more about a topic, consider a step-back, reevaluate your man sandals, and show us some respect that could lead to a prosperous relationship. But until then, have fun guys, we'll still keep our sense of humor about the quirks we, girls, truly dislike.
