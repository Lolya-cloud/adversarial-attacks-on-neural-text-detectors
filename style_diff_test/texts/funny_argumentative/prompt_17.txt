Clowns are supposed to be seen as entertaining characters that bring joy and laughter to people of all ages, but let's be honest here - they are downright terrifying. From their colorful attire, painted-on smiles and exaggerated features, clowns have been shown to be much scarier in reality than their intended purpose. In this essay, I argue that clowns are scarier than funny and supporting my argument with reasons why we should take them seriously.

Firstly, clowns have been used in horror movies as the main antagonist, and for good reason. They use their ability to appear friendly and harmless, deceiving their prey before pouncing on them with their sharp-toothed grins and sinister cackle. Their exaggerated features, like the oversized shoes and red noses, which are supposed to be humorous, can be just as creepy when used in dark lighting. This trend has become so ingrained in pop culture that most people's first thought when they think of a clown is that of a predator. No one wants to turn around and see a clown looming behind them with a knife.

Secondly, think about famous clowns, like Pennywise from the Stephen King novel, "It." The character is one of the most iconic villains in modern literature and entertainment, and he's a clown. Not a typical villain like Darth Vader or Voldemort, but a clown. That in itself shows how terrifying clowns can be, and how they can fill an audience with dread. Even Ronald McDonald, the popular mascot for McDonald's restaurants, has been shown to be an unpleasant memory for some people. In 2016, McDonald's announced that it would retire Ronald in favor of a healthier image. That says a lot about clowns, and how their presence can do more harm than good.

Lastly, clowns are also notorious for their unpredictability. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but you never know what kind of clown youâ€™re dealing with. One minute they could be juggling, and the next they could be pulling a pie test out of nowhere and slamming it into your face. This unpredictability is a breeding ground for anxiety and fear. Even when they are genuinely trying to be funny, their nonsensical stream of jokes, wordplay, and gestures leave the audience feeling confused and uncomfortable. This is because behind the painted smile there is always a possibility of something sinister lurking.

In conclusion, clowns are scarier than they are funny. They have a reputation that is donned in horror and fear, more than it is of joy and laughter. With their unpredictable nature, exaggerated features, and association with horror movies and cliche horror scenes, clowns, as they are, are not exactly welcome among humans. They are the embodied definition of fear itself. So, for all the people out there who feel the same way I do, let's stand up against the tyranny of the clown! Let's proclaim to the world that we don't want them hovering around in our parties, or making us their unwilling audience. Because when it comes down to it, clowns are anything but funny.
