As a student, you are probably aware of the different categories of students. There are the academically gifted, the athletes, the popular crowd, and then, there are the backbenchers. While many people might dismiss them as being lazy or not interested, the truth is that backbenchers are some of the smartest students in any school. You may wonder why backbenchers are smarter than other students, but trust me, the reasons are plenty.

Firstly, backbenchers have mastered the art of multitasking. While the students at the front are busy absorbing every word of their teacher, backbenchers can be found busy doing more than one task simultaneously. They are the kings and queens of stealth. They can doodle, read novels under their tables, and chat with their buddies without the teacher noticing. They are natural-born multitaskers who can handle multiple tasks without getting caught.

Secondly, backbenchers have developed an amazing sense of humor that allows them to stand out in any situation. They are quick-witted and hilarious. Their humor is so contagious that it can sometimes be heard throughout the class, which may lead to a suppression of their natural talent. Their humor is not only entertaining but also smart. They can make a joke out of anything and still manage to impress even the toughest of teachers. Backbenchers are the kings and queens of comedy.

Thirdly, backbenchers are experts in working under pressure. They are used to the feeling of being called upon at a moment's notice, having to answer complex questions on the spot, and perform well even when they haven't prepared. They have learned to be resourceful, think on their feet, and make the best of any situation. They are adaptable and can handle any challenge that comes their way. They might be called lazy, but the truth is they have more resilience than others.

Lastly, backbenchers have developed their own unique sense of style. While the students in the front row may adhere to a certain strict dress code, the backbenchers have their own fashion statement, which sets them apart from the rest. They have their own distinct fashion sense, which often shows a high degree of creativity and originality. They know how to mix and match clothes to create something eye-catching, and they are trendsetters in their own right.

In conclusion, backbenchers may not have the best reputation, but they have specific skills that put them ahead of other students. They can multitask, are quick-witted, are masters of handling pressure, and have a unique sense of style. Being a backbencher doesn't mean that you won’t have a bright future. Who knows? Maybe one day, the student who spends most of his or her time at the back of the class will become the CEO of the most successful companies or a renowned comedian. You're all good. Don't worry if you sit at the back — it could be the key to your success in life.
