The topic of professional athletes consuming steroids is highly controversial and has been a subject of much debate for many years. While some people argue that it is dangerous and unethical for athletes to use steroids to enhance their performance, others believe that it can help level the playing field and produce more exciting and record-breaking performances. In this essay, I will argue that professional athletes should be allowed to consume steroids.

Firstly, steroid use has become a common practice in the world of elite sports, whether allowed or not. In the current scenario where athletes are constantly seeking the competitive edge over their peers, the pressure to perform at the highest level has increased significantly. Although the use of steroids is illegal, it is still prevalent worldwide. Therefore, it seems logical to allow professional athletes to consume steroids to ensure a fair playing field for everyone involved in elite sports.

Additionally, steroids are not necessarily harmful to individual athletes, as long as they are consumed in monitored doses and under medical supervision. The sports world is full of different types of injuries that athletes are exposed to throughout their careers. Steroids that are used in a medically supervised manner can help athletes recover from injuries quickly and aid in faster healing. Furthermore, steroids can help athletes build muscle mass and endurance, giving them the capacity to perform better during matches.

Furthermore, many athletes are willing to take the risks associated with steroid use for personal gain. These athletes believe that steroids are worth the risk, as they can potentially earn more significant prize money, gain more extensive sponsorships, and secure their future in the sport they love. If steroids are allowed and monitored, the athletes who decide to use them can do so more safely and responsibly.

Opponents of this viewpoint may argue that steroid use is unfair and goes against the fundamental principles of fair play in sports. However, if steroids were allowed under strict medical supervision and in monitored doses, it can keep athletes from overdosing or using unsafe steroids that could harm their bodies in the long run. If the rules governing steroid use were stringent, any athlete who broke these rules could face harsh penalties, including loss of reputation, fines, and suspension.

Furthermore, with the ever-increasing demands of performance in modern-day sports and competitions, it is essential to make sure that athletes are performing at their best. Steroids are just one of the many aids available to athletes in modern times, and they should not be banned if other forms of performance enhancements such as protein supplements, energy drinks, or even concentration-enhancing drugs are allowed. The status quo on banning steroids should be reassessed in light of the current need for athletes to perform at the highest level.

In conclusion, professional athletes should be allowed to consume steroids under strict medical supervision and rules that govern them. Steroids can help level the playing field and ensure a fair and exciting performance among all athletes. With proper monitoring, athletes who choose to use steroids can do so safely and with minimal health risks while allowing them to achieve higher levels of performance. It is time to reconsider the current rules governing steroid use in sports.
