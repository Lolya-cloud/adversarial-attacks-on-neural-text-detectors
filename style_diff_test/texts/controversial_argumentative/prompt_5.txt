Leadership is an essential aspect of every society. Every human activity requires some level of leadership. Leaders have numerous qualities that enable them to inspire, guide and direct people towards a common goal or objective. The question that has plagued humanity for ages is whether leaders are born or made. Some people believe that leaders are born, while others argue that anyone can become a leader. This essay presents a controversial argument that leaders are made, not born.

The argument that leaders are born has its roots in the notion that some individuals possess inherent qualities or traits that make them natural-born leaders. These traits may include charisma, intelligence, and strong personality, among others. According to this perspective, these inherent traits enable some individuals to stand at the forefront and lead others admirably. However, this argument is flawed since it fails to acknowledge the role of environmental factors in leadership development. Individuals can learn leadership skills and acquire the traits associated with successful leadership.

Leadership skills are developed through training, education, and experience. Leadership development programs provide the necessary experience, knowledge, and skills for individuals to become effective leaders. Training programs offer opportunities for individuals to learn about communication, delegation, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, education provides leaders with a broader understanding of politics, economics, and social issues, thus enabling them to make informed decisions. Leaders are also made through experience, where individuals learn from the challenges they face, and the successes they achieve.

The idea that leaders are born is also flawed when viewed from a practical standpoint. The world has countless examples of leaders who were not born with the qualities or traits ascribed to natural-born leaders. Leaders such as Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela were not born with inherent leadership abilities. These inspiring leaders acquired their leadership skills through tough experiences, education, and training, thus refuting the notion that leaders are naturally gifted.

Moreover, the argument that leaders are born can be used to stifle potential leaders and limit their growth. If leadership qualities were genetically predetermined, it would mean that only a few individuals would possess the necessary leadership traits and skills. This would lead to a highly selective society where only those individuals with the right genes would become leaders. The belief that leaders are born can diminish the confidence of aspiring leaders, making them feel that they do not possess the necessary qualities to lead.

In conclusion, the idea that leaders are born is a flawed argument. Leadership is not an inherited trait but a set of qualities and skills that can be learned, practiced, and honed. Although some people may naturally exhibit traits that are associated with successful leadership, these traits are not the sole determinant of successful leadership. Individuals can learn and develop leadership skills through training, education, and experience. The belief that leaders are born can also limit the potential of aspiring leaders by making them feel that they do not possess the qualities needed for leadership. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge that leaders are made, not born, since this perspective encourages leadership development and growth for all individuals.
