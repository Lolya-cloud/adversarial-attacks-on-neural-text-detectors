Political policies and practices have always had a remarkable impact on students and their educational careers. They are the driving force behind the implementation of education policies and practices, which in turn have far-reaching consequences for students. In recent years, political policies and practices affecting students have become a controversial topic, with some arguing that they are limiting students' potential and diminishing the standard of education. In this essay, we will examine how political policies and practices affect students and why they are fiercely contested.

One of the primary concerns with political policies and practices affecting students is that they are often biased and reflect the political ideologies of those in power. This bias is particularly problematic when it comes to the implementation of education policies. For example, policies that promote charter schools or standardized testing may favor certain groups of students over others. Students from low-income families are often left behind as they lack the resources to attend these charter schools and may not perform well on standardized tests.

Moreover, these policies have consequences that go beyond the education system. Limiting the potential of students can lead to significant economic and social costs for society as a whole. Students who do not receive a good education are less likely to enter higher education and will be unprepared to contribute to the workforce. This situation can lead to a social divide, as those from affluent families can afford a better education, while those from lower-income families cannot.

Furthermore, the political policies and practices that affect students can have long-lasting consequences. For example, the policies and practices that promote the militarization of schools can have a negative impact on students' mental and emotional wellbeing. This approach creates an environment that is reminiscent of a prison, where students are under surveillance, and police presence is widespread. Instead of creating an environment that is conducive to learning, policies like these can make it difficult for students to feel safe and valued, leading to a lack of motivation and disengagement from learning.

However, there are those who argue that political policies and practices affecting students are necessary to ensure that schools are effective and efficient. These individuals argue that there are no other ways to achieve academic excellence other than through standardization and accountability. They believe that the policies they promote help to hold teachers and schools accountable for the quality of education they provide. Moreover, they argue that these policies help to control costs and prevent the government from wasting public funds.

In conclusion, political policies and practices are essential to ensuring the success of a country's education system. However, it's essential to ensure that these policies and practices do not have far-reaching unintended consequences. Policies that promote standardization, charter schools, and militarization are not necessarily the most effective ways to promote academic excellence. Instead, political policymakers should focus on promoting policies that are inclusive and create a safe and supportive environment for all students. By doing so, we can ensure that our education system promotes equity and helps to build a robust and inclusive society.
