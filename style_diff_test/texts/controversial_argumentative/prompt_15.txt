The topic of abortion is one that has been debated and legislated upon for decades. Proponents argue that women must have the right to choose what happens to their bodies, while opponents argue that fetuses constitute life and cannot be terminated. Despite the controversy surrounding the issue, abortions should be legalized.

Firstly, the right to make decisions about one's own body is a fundamental right. Women should be empowered to choose what happens within their own bodies without fear of legal repercussions. Pregnancy and childbirth are not simple, easy experiences, and women who do not wish to go through them should not be forced to.

Moreover, making abortions illegal does not prevent them from happening; it only makes them more dangerous. Historically, when abortions were illegal, women still sought out these services, often turning to unqualified and unlicensed providers. As a result, many women suffered complications, infections and, in some cases, death. By legalizing abortions, governments can better regulate and provide access to safe and hygienic medical procedures.

Furthermore, women who are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term often suffer negative economic, social, and emotional consequences. Unplanned pregnancies can be financially burdensome, and many women are forced to drop out of school or work to care for the child. Additionally, children born to parents who do not want them may suffer from abuse or neglect. In contrast, legalizing abortions can provide women with the option of parenthood if they are financially and emotionally prepared for it.

On the other hand, opponents of legalizing abortions argue that fetuses constitute human life and that abortion is therefore an immoral act. However, the argument that a fetus is equivalent to a fully-formed human being is unsound. Although a fetus has the potential to develop into a human being, it is not one yet. Furthermore, granting fetuses human rights unfairly infringes upon the rights of women.

Moreover, opponents of legalizing abortions argue that adoption is a viable alternative and that women with unwanted pregnancies should be encouraged to carry them to term and give them up for adoption. While this may be an option for some women, it is a complicated and often emotionally traumatic experience. Additionally, there are currently hundreds of thousands of children in the foster care system, many of whom languish in the system for years. Encouraging more unwanted children into the system is not a sustainable solution.

In conclusion, the argument that women should not have the right to make decisions about their own bodies is outdated and unsound. Legalizing abortions ensures that women have access to safe and hygienic medical procedures, protects their fundamental rights, and prevents negative economic, social, and emotional outcomes. While opposition to legalizing abortions may be rooted in moral convictions, the burden of that opposition falls disproportionately on women. Consequently, abortions should be legalized.
