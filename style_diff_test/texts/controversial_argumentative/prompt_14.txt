Illegal immigrants should be given equal rights because they are human beings just like any other person. Everyone deserves to enjoy basic human rights and privileges; this principle should not exclude illegal immigrants. Despite the fact that many people believe that illegal immigrants should not be given the same rights as citizens, such a view is myopic, short-sighted, and hypocritical. Illegal immigrants are working hard to make America a better place, and they should be appreciated for that. This essay seeks to argue that illegal immigrants should be given equal rights because they contribute to the American economy, they are productive members of society, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

First, illegal immigrants should be given equal rights because they contribute to the American economy. Illegal immigrants are just as hardworking and committed as any other employee. They pay taxes, and many have started small businesses that help the American economy to thrive. Research shows that immigrants, both legal and illegal, contribute a great deal to the American economy. They learn American customs and culture, and they use their skills and knowledge to create wealth and improve the lifestyle of everyone in America. It is only fair to grant them equal rights and privileges.

Second, illegal immigrants should be given equal rights because they are productive members of society. They work hard to succeed, and they are determined to make a better life for themselves and their families. They attend classes and learn the English language so that they can communicate effectively. They also volunteer in community programs and events, and they participate in religious activities. They are no different from other Americans in terms of their commitment to better the society. Illegal immigrants should be given equal opportunities to contribute to society and make it a better place for everyone.

Lastly, illegal immigrants should be given equal rights because they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Every human being deserves to be treated with kindness, compassion, and empathy. The way society treats immigrants reflects its values and principles. If immigrants are treated poorly and unfairly, it reflects negatively on the society as a whole. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of their citizenship status or place of birth.

To conclude, illegal immigrants should be given equal rights because they contribute to the American economy, they are productive members of society, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. America should be a society that celebrates diversity and inclusivity. All people should be welcomed and given the chance to thrive and succeed. Rather than focusing on the differences between illegal immigrants and citizens, we should find ways to foster greater solidarity and understanding between natives and non-natives. We should recognize that we are all human beings who deserve the same basic rights and privileges. Therefore, equal rights should be granted to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.
