Smoking is one of the most common habits that has been prevalent in human society for centuries. Despite being aware of its adverse health effects and harmful consequences in the long run, people continue to smoke. The environmental causes of smoking play a crucial role in shaping their behavior towards smoking. Environmental factors greatly influence the likelihood of adolescents to become regular smokers and continue smoking even in adulthood.

The first and most significant environmental factor that leads to smoking is peer pressure. Peer pressure is a common phenomenon among teenagers and young adults, where they feel a social obligation to conform to the habits of their peers. If their peers smoke, they may feel the need to join in to gain acceptance and approval from the group. In many cases, individuals may begin smoking in their early teenage years to fit in with their peers, and then continue smoking to maintain their social connection.

Another environmental factor that leads to smoking is exposure to smoking through media and advertising. Smoking has been portrayed as an attractive image of society through movies, television shows, magazines, and advertisements. This portrayal usually targets young adults to create an impression that smoking is the act of being “cool” or “adventurous”. The problem here is that it creates a positive image of an activity that has a negative impact on people’s health. As a result, many young people emulate these poor role models and take up smoking.

Another significant environmental factor that leads to smoking is family influence. Children learn from their parents and siblings, who are typically the most influential family figures. Children brought up in an environment where smoking is considered “normal” are more likely to start smoking themselves. Parents who smoke around their children create a smoking-positive environment, and children may learn that smoking is part of everyday life, as well as a norm that should be embraced. Also, if the parents smoke, they may not object to their children smoking, thereby providing them with easy access to cigarettes.

The psychological impact of environmental factors on individuals cannot be ignored. Stress and anxiety from a working environment or personal life of individuals can increase smoking behavior. This is the case when individuals slide towards a smoking habit to manage stress levels or anxiety, they feel at certain points in time. For people who already have a nicotine dependency, smoking can provide them with short-term relief but not contribute positively to their long-term well-being.

In conclusion, the environmental causes of smoking are shaped by a wide range of factors such as peer pressure, media and advertising, family influence, and psychological impacts related to either anxiety or workplace environment. We need to take a multi-faceted approach to prevent smoking and encourage smokers to give up cigarettes. Reducing access to cigarettes, expanding smoking cessation programs, and educating the public on the dangers of smoking are among the initiatives that should be pursued. The focus of prevention efforts should start during adolescence, to sustain educational programs for young people and counter the negative influence of environmental causes. If efforts are made to address these environmental factors, we could reduce smoking and create a healthier society.
