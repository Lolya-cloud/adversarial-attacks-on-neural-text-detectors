Growing up as the youngest of three siblings had its challenges, but it also had its rewards. From the time I was born, it seemed as though my older brother and sister held all the power, and I was constantly trying to play catch up to be included in their games and conversations. As I grew up, I found my own voice and place in the family dynamic, but there came a time when I wished I was an only child.

It started with a disagreement over the TV remote. My sister wanted to watch a show that I wasn't interested in, and I wanted to watch something else. We argued and fought about it until my brother intervened and took the remote away from both of us. It was at that moment that I realized how much easier life would be if I were an only child. I wouldn't have to share anything, and I could do what I wanted without having to worry about anyone else's opinion.

As time went on, my dissatisfaction with being the youngest and having to share everything only grew. I couldn't help but feel like my siblings were always against me, and I just wanted to be free of their constant bickering and disagreements. The final straw came when my sister borrowed one of my prized possessions without asking and returned it broken. When I confronted her about it, she refused to take responsibility, and I felt like nobody was on my side.

I remember the night vividly when I lay in bed, tears streaming down my face, and prayed to be an only child. It was the first time I had ever asked for something like that, but in that moment, it seemed like the only solution to all my problems. I imagined a life without any siblings, where I could have everything to myself, and nobody would be there to argue or disagree with me.

The next morning, I woke up feeling like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I still had my siblings, but I was no longer attached to them emotionally. I started to distance myself from them, spending more time alone or with my friends instead. It wasn't long before my siblings noticed the change in me and started to ask questions.

I told them how I had felt and how I had prayed to be an only child. To my surprise, they didn't get angry or upset. Instead, they listened and acknowledged my feelings. They told me how much they loved me and how much they wanted to work together to make our family dynamic better. It was a turning point in our relationship, and from that day forward, we started to communicate more openly and honestly.

Looking back on that time now, I realize that while praying to be an only child was a temporary solution, it was a catalyst for change in our family. It forced us to confront our issues and work towards a better relationship. Today, I am grateful to have my siblings in my life, and I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world.
