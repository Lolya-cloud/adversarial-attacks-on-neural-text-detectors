As a child, we tend to believe that our parents are always right, and we rarely question their decisions or actions. However, as we grow older and gain more life experiences, we realize that our parents are not infallible and that they too make mistakes and can be wrong sometimes. One experience that made me realize that my parents weren't always right was when I decided to pursue a career in a field that they disapproved of.

Growing up, my parents always had high expectations for me. They were both successful professionals, and they wanted me to follow in their footsteps and become a doctor or a lawyer. They believed that these were the only respectable and lucrative careers that would guarantee me a secure future. I, on the other hand, had different aspirations. I was drawn to the creative arts, particularly filmmaking. I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else but telling stories through film.

When I shared my passion for filmmaking with my parents, they were not impressed. They dismissed it as a silly hobby and told me that I would never make a living out of it. They believed that I was wasting my time and that I should focus on getting a "real" job. I was crushed. I felt like my parents didn't understand me and my dreams. But I didn't give up on my passion. I worked hard and honed my skills, and eventually, I got accepted into a prestigious film school.

The day I told my parents that I was going to become a filmmaker was one of the hardest moments of my life. I expected them to be proud of me, but instead, they were disappointed and angry. They told me that I was making a mistake and that I would regret it. They said that I was throwing away my future and that I would end up as a starving artist.

Their words hurt me, but I decided to follow my heart and pursue my dreams, regardless of what they thought. At film school, I thrived. I discovered a community of like-minded individuals who shared my passion for storytelling and filmmaking. I learned so much about the art and the craft of making films, and I loved every minute of it.

Years later, when I started to have some success as a filmmaker, my parents started to come around. They saw that I was happy and fulfilled in my career, and they were proud of my accomplishments. They realized that I hadn't made a mistake and that I had found my calling in life.

That experience taught me that my parents weren't always right and that I had to follow my own path in life. It also made me realize that our parents' expectations and beliefs can sometimes be limiting and that we have to challenge them to achieve our full potential. I'm grateful for that experience because it helped me grow as a person and as an artist, and it showed me that I could achieve anything I set my mind to, even if it went against my parents' wishes.
