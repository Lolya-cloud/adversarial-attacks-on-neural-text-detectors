As someone who has always prided themselves on being discerning and intuitive, I have always been quick to form judgments about the people I encounter. So when I met Alex, my initial impression of him was not a positive one. He was loud, brash, and seemed to take pleasure in putting others down. Although we had some mutual friends and often found ourselves in the same social circles, I did my best to avoid him whenever possible.

One autumn afternoon, however, something happened that completely changed my outlook on Alex. I was on my way to an important meeting on campus, but as I stepped outside the sky suddenly opened up and rain began to pour down in sheets. I had forgotten my umbrella and was about to resign myself to getting soaked, when I heard a voice call out to me from behind.

It was Alex. He had apparently been walking a few steps behind me and had caught up just in time to shield me with his own umbrella. At first, I was hesitant to accept his help - after all, I had always seen him as someone who enjoyed teasing and criticizing others. But there was something about the way he looked at me - with an earnestness and sincerity that I had never seen before - that made me trust him in that moment.

We walked in silence for a few minutes, the rain pounding against the umbrella and our feet splashing through puddles. At first, I was wary of any attempts at small talk, afraid that Alex would revert back to his usual braggadocio and put-downs. But he surprised me again by continuing to treat me with kindness and respect, offering me words of encouragement as we made our way across campus.

As the rain began to let up and we reached our destination, I found myself feeling truly grateful and surprised by the unexpected kindness that Alex had shown me. I never would have thought that someone who I had dismissed so easily could turn out to be such a decent human being.

In the weeks and months that followed, I found myself slowly starting to see Alex in a different light. Although he still had moments of insecurity or bragging, I began to notice and appreciate the moments where he reached out to others with empathy and kindness. Whether it was taking a younger student under his wing or showing up at a friend's event despite his busy schedule, Alex was consistently surprising me with his generosity of spirit.

Looking back on that rainy afternoon now, I see it as a turning point in my own growth as a person. I realize that my snap judgments and assumptions about others had been blinding me to the possibility of genuine connection and kindness with people who may at first seem unlikeable or annoying. And I am grateful to Alex for showing me that sometimes, the people who we have written off can end up surprising us in the most unexpected and beautiful ways.
