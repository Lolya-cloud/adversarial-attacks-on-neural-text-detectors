With the rise of technological advancements, our relationship with technology has changed. Many people argue that technology has brought people closer by reducing the distance, while others claim that it has increased the distance and has actually made them feel more isolated and lonely. This essay will examine the evidence that suggests technology plays a role in making people feel more isolated and lonely.

Firstly, people are spending more time online than ever before, which leads to a reduction in face-to-face interactions. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have made it easier to communicate with people, but these forms of communication are not the same as meeting someone in person. Social media can create a false sense of connection, where people think they are communicating with others, without actually having personal interactions.

Secondly, technology has made it easier for people to avoid face-to-face interactions, which is essential for building strong relationships. The ease of online communication has made people prioritize online conversations over in-person interactions. Spendings time alone with tablets and computers decreases the time needed to interact with others in face-to-face conversations. This can result in people feeling isolated and lonely as they do not have enough interactive experiences that make up a happy life.

Thirdly, technology has contributed to the normalization of being alone. People can entertain themselves with the internet, movies, music, and social media, which means they do not need to socialize with others as much as they did several years ago. Although self-care is necessary, excessively spending time alone can make people feel lonely and disconnected from the world.

However,there can be arguments made in favour of technology playing a role in reducing loneliness. With technology, it's easier to reach out to people who are far away from us, or who we haven't communicated in a long time. It ensures that people can still stay in touch with their loved ones, which could come in handy for people to maintain long-distance relationships or strengthen them. This point carries the potential for technology to facilitate communication effectively and help to reduce people's isolation.

As a result of the points above, technology plays a role in making people feel more isolated. It can also lead to people feeling lonely and disconnected from the world, which can have severe implications on mental health. This is especially important to recognize and address amidst the pandemic, where people have been forced to communicate through a screen more than ever before. It is crucial to strike a balance between technology and social interaction. People need to recognize the importance of face-to-face interactions for emotional well-being and prioritize it. We must look for ways to use technology to facilitate communication effectively while ensuring we do not lose out on the critical face-to-face experience we all need.
