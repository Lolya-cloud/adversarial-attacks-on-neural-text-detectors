Tobacco use is undoubtedly one of the deadliest habits in human history. It is the leading cause of many fatal diseases, including lung cancer, heart attacks, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Tobacco companies make huge profits from the sale of their products, yet they do not bear the responsibility for the deadly consequences of their commodities. This is the reason why producing and selling tobacco should be made illegal.

Firstly, tobacco use has severe consequences on human health. Smokers expose themselves to various fatal diseases and illnesses, including lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, asthma, and heart disease. Passive smoking is equally dangerous, and it can lead to the same deadly diseases. In addition to the harm it causes to individual health, tobacco use also poses a threat to public health. When people smoke in public places, they expose the people around them to the harmful effects of cigarettes. This is a major reason why governments around the world have taken steps to limit smoking in public spaces.

Furthermore, the production and sale of tobacco products support a highly questionable industry. Tobacco companies spend millions of dollars on advertising to lure people into smoking and making more profit. The industry even targets minors, which is a completely unethical practice. Children and teenagers are generally more susceptible to peer pressure, which exposes them to the temptation to start smoking. This easily leads to nicotine addiction that endangers their health. Such negative outcomes for the youth are directly caused by the unregulated sale and advertisement of tobacco products.

Moreover, tobacco consumption contributes to a significant economic burden on society. Tobacco-related health issues increase the cost of healthcare services. Additionally, tobacco use leads to the decrease of productivity in society as a result of sick leave and premature deaths. Governments lose tax revenue due to the reduced productivity and increased spending on healthcare. Moreover, the compensation money that tobacco companies pay for their malpractice is also a burden on society.

Lastly, by making tobacco production illegal, the government can help limit the repercussions of the industry. The illegality of tobacco sales would stop the advertising of the products, leading to reduced pressure on people to take up smoking. Such measures would undoubtedly save many lives each year and also reduce the economic burden on society that tobacco companies cause.

In conclusion, tobacco use is a universally destructive habit. The negative effects of tobacco on human health, society, and the economy outweigh any reasons for its continued production and sale. By making tobacco production and sales illegal, the government can take a major step towards reducing the harm caused by tobacco exposure. The tobacco industry must be held accountable for the societal burden that it causes, and their commodity should be banned to create a healthier world for all.
