The education system has been the subject of scrutiny over the years. Many schools have faced criticism due to their rigid and inflexible curriculums. The curriculum has a significant impact on students' academic lives, shaping their future. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that the curriculum is tailored to meet individual student needs. School students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum as it will aid in their personal and academic growth, increase their productivity, and enhance their learning experience.

Allowing students to curate their curriculum would foster personal and academic growth. An educational program that resonates with a student's interests and strengths can help build a solid foundation for learning. For instance, students who have a passion for the arts can choose to focus more on creative disciplines such as visual arts, music, or drama. A curriculum that reflects student interests can foster creativity, intellectual curiosity, and critical thinking, inspiring students to be more engaged with their education and develop meaningful lifelong learning habits.

In addition, allowing students to create their curriculum promotes productivity. High school students are more motivated to meet academic requirements that align with their passion and goals. It is, therefore, necessary to provide them with the opportunity to choose classes they are passionate about, thus unleashing their potential. Furthermore, a student who is interested in a particular subject is more likely to excel in the subject than one who is not. Simply put, allowing students to curate their curriculum can increase student productivity and provide them with the necessary motivation to excel academically.

Moreover, allowing students to curate their curriculum would enhance their learning experience. A curriculum that is inflexible and one-size-fits-all can be disadvantageous to some students. Many schools have various support systems for students who face challenges academically, such as tutoring or individualized sessions with teachers.

However, these systems do not cater to the needs of all students, and many students can become demotivated if their struggles are not addressed. Allowing students to curate their curriculum can address this problem and create a more balanced learning experience for these students. Students who are struggling in certain subjects can focus on other areas of interest, and those who are excelling in a particular subject can pursue it further. Furthermore, the curriculum curation will enable students to build skills that will support their academic and personal goals, as they will be making choices based on their strengths and interests.

To conclude, students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. It is an essential step toward promoting personal and academic growth, productivity, and enhancing their learning experience. With a structured approach and reasonable constraints, schools can ensure that the curriculum meets educational standards while still catering to individual student needs. Through educational programs that reflect their interests and passions, students can build meaningful lifelong learning habits and be well prepared for a successful future. Therefore, school administrators should implement a system that grants students the power to choose classes that align with their interests, passion, and goals.
