Politics is a profession that requires a unique set of skills. The art of politics requires effective communication, strategic planning, public relations, diplomacy, analytical and negotiation skills. The question as to whether politicians are born or made has been a subject of debate for many years. While some argue that politicians are natural leaders born with innate abilities, others believe that anyone can develop the necessary skills needed. In my opinion, politicians are not born but rather made. This is because becoming a politician is a learning process, and anyone can master the art of politics if they put in the effort.

To begin with, politics is not an inherited trait but rather a crafted skill. It is true that some individuals may be born with certain innate qualities like charisma, confidence, and eloquence, which are essential skills in politics. However, having these skills is not enough to make one an effective politician. There are other skillsets that one needs to learn to be a successful politician. For instance, good communication, effective public speaking, sound decision-making, and negotiation skills are all skills that can be learned. There is no such thing as a natural-born politician. Even the most successful politicians once had to learn and develop these necessary skills.

Furthermore, politics is a profession that one learns through experience. Political experience can significantly influence an individual's ability to become a successful politician. Politicians who have been in the field for an extended period have learned through experience, and with time, they acquire essential skills such as strategic planning, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. These skills cannot be learned in a classroom or by birth. It takes years of practice and exposure to various situations for an individual to become an effective politician.

Additionally, many successful politicians started out with minimal knowledge and skills in politics. However, through determination and hard work, they were able to develop and master the art of politics. It takes a lot of effort and dedication to become a successful politician. One needs to be willing to learn, listen, and adapt to different situations.

Lastly, politics is not a profession that is limited to a particular group of people. Anyone can become a politician if they are willing to learn. People from different walks of life have become politicians and have succeeded in the field. For instance, Barack Obama started as a community organizer and later became a state legislator before becoming the first African-American president of the United States. He was not born with political skills but worked hard and learned the necessary skills needed to become an effective politician.

In conclusion, the idea that politicians are born with certain abilities is a myth. Becoming a politician requires effort, determination, and a willingness to learn. One can develop the necessary skills needed to become an effective politician with hard work and dedication. Therefore, the art of politics is learned, not an innate ability that people are born with. While some may be predisposed to certain traits that suit a politician, it is the learning process that makes someone an effective one.
