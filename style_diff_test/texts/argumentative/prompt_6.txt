Social media has changed the way we communicate, share information, and interact with our peers. It has become an essential part of everyoneâ€™s life where people can create, share, and comment on different types of content. However, it has created a platform for hateful and discriminatory language, which can have a significant impact on society. Social media platform owners should monitor and block comments containing hateful language to create a safer environment for users to communicate and share ideas.

Firstly, hateful language can have a detrimental effect on individuals and groups within society. Inappropriate and discriminatory comments can lead to anxiety, distress, and mental health problems. It also contributes to the marginalization and social exclusion of particular groups, including individuals with disabilities, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community, perpetuating a cycle of hatred and inequality. Monitoring and blocking hateful language can help prevent the spread of discrimination and help create a more inclusive society.

Secondly, monitoring and blocking hateful language aligns with social media platforms' values of promoting safety and mutual respect. Social media platforms have a role to play in shaping the content that their users see. They can control the atmosphere that they create, helping to promote positive and welcoming discourse online. Platforms that promote hate speech do so to attract more users and engagement, which can lead to more advertising revenue. By monitoring hate speech, these social media platforms can ensure safe spaces for their users and prevent the degradation of their services.

Thirdly, failing to monitor hateful language can cause real-world harm. Hate speech may incite violence, harassment, and abuse of marginalized groups. By allowing hateful language to exist on a platform, social media platform owners become complicit in any violent acts that might arise from this discourse. The platform is also likely to receive negative publicity if it becomes a hotbed for hate speech. It's the responsibility of platform owners to ensure that the interaction on their platform aligns with the principles of security and mutual respect.

Lastly, monitoring and blocking hateful language will not stifle free speech. Free speech does not extend to racial, derogatory, or discriminatory speech that causes harm to individuals or groups. People have the freedom to express their opinions, but they are not entitled to a platform to disseminate hateful speech. Social media platforms are not required to host unfettered speech. The freedom to express oneself should not be used as an excuse to promote harmful speech that creates an unsafe environment for others.

In conclusion, social media platform owners should take responsibility for monitoring and blocking comments containing hate speech. This is necessary to promote a society where discriminatory language is not accepted, to ensure a positive and welcoming discourse online, to prevent real-world harm, and to ensure that free speech does not facilitate hate. By doing so, social media platforms become accountable for shaping a safe and fulfilling online culture.
