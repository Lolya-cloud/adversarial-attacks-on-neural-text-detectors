In today's society, sexual activity among teenagers and young adults has become a common phenomenon. Despite this, many students are ignorant about the consequences of sex, especially unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). To prevent such occurrences, it is necessary to provide sex education in high schools as it teaches students about responsible sexual behavior. Therefore, sex education should be mandatory in high schools across the country.

Firstly, sex education is an essential subject in high schools because it provides students with valuable information about sex, contraception, and STDs. It helps students understand the risks associated with sexual behavior and how to avoid them. When students are knowledgeable about sexual behavior, they are less likely to engage in risky or unsafe behaviors, resulting in lower pregnancy and STD rates. By learning about contraception, they can protect themselves during sexual intercourse, avoiding unintended pregnancies. Moreover, sex education would support gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students, providing them with accurate information to navigate their sexual orientation.

Furthermore, sex education can foster healthier relationships among young adults. It provides students with valuable information about intimacy, communication, and consent, essential components of any relationship. For instance, sex education teaches young adults about consent, respect, and communication in sexual relationships. Students learn about the importance of freely given consent and how it prevents sexual violence, coercion, and abuse. They also learn how to communicate their boundaries and understand those of their partner, ensuring that both parties feel respected and comfortable during intimacy.

Moreover, a mandatory sex education curriculum would bridge the gap between parental guidance and students' knowledge. Some parents are reluctant to talk about sex with their children, leaving them uninformed about the consequences of sexual behavior. In contrast, teachers can provide comprehensive information, addressing topics that parents may avoid discussing to avoid self-incrimination or shame. Consequently, sex education would ensure that young adults receive accurate and reliable information rather than relying on unreliable sources.

Lastly, sex education can help reduce the stigmatization experienced by individuals who are sexually active or have been diagnosed with an STD. Often, individuals who engage in sexual activities are stigmatized due to societal biases and beliefs. This stigma can lead to self-shame, guilt, and ignorance about the proper handling of their situations. With sex education, students learn about the myths and complexities of various STDs and understand that their situations are manageable. Moreover, sex education creates a safe space for students to ask questions, dispel myths, and address any health issues they may have.

In conclusion, mandatory sex education should be implemented in high schools to ensure young adults have the necessary information and knowledge to make informed decisions about their sexual behavior. By providing comprehensive knowledge about sex, contraception, and STDs, sex education would reduce risky sexual behavior, improve sexual health, and foster healthy relationships. Therefore, policymakers should recognize the importance of sex education in high schools and prioritize its implementation.
