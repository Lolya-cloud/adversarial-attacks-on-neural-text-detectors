In today's competitive world, students are challenged to excel academically while balancing extra-curricular activities, community service, and other commitments. Students are often piled up with homework, assignments, projects, and exams. This heavy workload can have a detrimental impact on a student's mental and physical health. Therefore, schools should reduce the workload on students to help them live a balanced and healthy life.

There is no denying the fact that education is essential for success in life. However, the current education system emphasizes "excellence" and "success" at the cost of a student's health. Rapidly increasing academic pressure, technological advancements, and an ever-increasing competition have turned the educational environment into a pressure cooker. Students are often seen staying up late at night to complete their assignments or sacrificing their sleep to cram for an exam.

Reducing the workload on students would lead to several benefits, including improved mental and physical health. According to a study conducted by the National Survey of Children's Health, students who have too much homework have a higher risk of developing negative health effects such as stomach problems, headaches, sleep deprivation, and exhaustion. Such students are also more prone to developing anxiety and depression. By reducing the workload, students would be able to dedicate more time to activities that promote good health, such as playing or engaging in sports, socializing with friends, or resting.

Research shows that excessive homework and assignments do not necessarily improve academic performance. A study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that countries with less homework, such as Finland, Japan, and Denmark, have higher ranks in the education system than countries with more homework, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Instead of assigning excessive homework, schools should allocate more time for classroom interaction and hands-on activities, which would enable students to develop a better understanding of the material.

Another benefit of reducing the workload is that it would allow students to explore their interests and passions. Students should be given the opportunity to focus on areas that they are passionate about, such as music, art, sports, or drama, which would enable them to discover their talents and develop their potential. With a reduced workload, students would have more time to pursue their interests and participate in extra-curricular activities.

Reducing the workload on students would also help bridge the gap between students from different socio-economic backgrounds. Students who come from privileged backgrounds tend to have more resources, such as personal tutors, that reduce their workload. Such students have an unfair advantage over their less privileged counterparts. By reducing the workload, schools would help level the playing field and provide equal opportunities for all students to achieve academic success.

In conclusion, schools should reduce the workload on students to enable them to live a balanced and healthy life. Reducing the workload would lead to several benefits, including improved mental and physical health, increased academic performance, enhanced exploration of interests and passions, and bridging the gap between privileged and less privileged students. It is high time that educational institutions emphasized the wellbeing of students instead of their academic achievement alone.
