In recent years, violence has become a rampant issue worldwide, and violent video games have been in the spotlight for causing aggression and hostility in players. It is widely acknowledged that video games have a significant impact on people's behavior, especially young children. In light of the ill effects that are increasingly being linked to violent video gaming, a debate has arisen as to whether these games should be banned. In this essay, I will present the argument that violent video games should be banned.

The impact of violent video games on young children can have a significant impact on their behavior, leading to hostile and aggressive tendencies. Many studies have shown that violent video games have a direct correlation with an increase in aggressive behavior in young children, and this correlation has only increased in recent years. Children who are exposed to violent video games are at a higher risk of resorting to violent behavior, including bullying, fighting, and other forms of aggression. With this in mind, it is essential to consider the negative effects violent video games can have on young children's development, and steps need to be taken to prevent it.

Another concerning issue related to violent video games is the desensitization many players experience. When children spend an excessive amount of time playing violent video games, they start to see violence as normal and acceptable. This way of thinking can lead to a lack of empathy and sensitivity to real-life violence. A society that is increasingly desensitized to violence is not a desirable outcome, and the elimination of violent video games is a crucial step to address this issue.

The argument often heard against the banning of violent video games is that it is an infringement on individual liberty and a violation of the freedom of expression. However, banning these games is not the same as censorship. It is a measure taken to protect young children's well-being from being subjected to violence and aggression unnecessarily. It is not a restriction on the creative freedom of game designers but instead an acknowledgment of the responsibility that comes with their work.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the banning of violent video games is not a new idea. Many countries have already taken steps to reduce the impact of these games on young children. In Australia, for example, R18+ classification guidelines have been implemented, which prohibit games with excessive gore, sexual violence, and drug use. Similarly, in Germany, there are strict restrictions on the use of violent video games. Many others have followed suit, proving that banning these games is a viable option.

In conclusion, violent video games have no place in our society, and they should be banned. The negative impact they have on young children's behavior and development far outweigh the perceived benefits they offer. With the increase in violence and aggression in young children, it is essential to take proactive steps to ensure their safety and well-being. While banning violent video games may be seen as a restriction or infringement on individual freedom, it is a measure that is needed to ensure a safer and more nurturing environment for our children.
