Vlogging, or video blogging, has become a popular way for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives with a larger audience online. However, there has been a debate over whether vlogging is a legitimate profession. While some believe vlogging can provide a sustainable income and should be considered a profession, others argue that it is not a real job and lacks the necessary components to be considered a profession.

First and foremost, vlogging lacks the necessary training and educational requirements typically associated with a profession. Unlike traditional careers such as medicine or law, there is no formal education or certification required to become a vlogger. This means that anyone can start a vlogging channel and call themselves a professional. While some vloggers may have natural talent or creativity in creating engaging content, it does not necessarily make them professionals.

Another issue with vlogging as a profession is that it lacks consistent and reliable income. Unlike a traditional job with a stable salary and benefits, vloggers often rely on advertising revenue and sponsorships, which can quickly disappear if their popularity or viewership decline. This instability can make it difficult for vloggers to make a steady income and plan for their future.

In addition, vlogging does not usually require a formal workplace, set hours, or a manager, unlike traditional professions. Vloggers have the freedom to work from anywhere, at any time, which can lead to a lack of structure and accountability. This lack of structure can also make it difficult for vloggers to maintain a healthy work-life balance and can lead to burnout.

Furthermore, vlogging requires self-promotion and personal branding to build an audience and stay relevant. While this may seem like a benefit of the profession, it can also be a significant challenge for vloggers. Maintaining a personal brand and constant self-promotion can be mentally and emotionally taxing, and it can also make it difficult to form genuine connections with audiences.

Many argue that the rise of successful vloggers such as Zoella, Lilly Singh, and Casey Neistat proves that vlogging is a legitimate profession. However, it is important to note that these individuals have not achieved success solely through vlogging alone. They have diversified their income streams by branching out into other forms of media and business ventures, such as creating merchandise or producing their TV shows. Furthermore, these individuals have a rare level of talent, charisma, and business acumen that not all vloggers possess.

In conclusion, while vlogging can be a creative and entertaining way to express oneself and build a following, it lacks the necessary components to be considered a real profession. The lack of formal education and training, inconsistent income, the absence of structured workplace hours, self-promotion, and personal branding, make it difficult to classify vlogging as a legitimate profession. While there may be exceptions to the rule, vlogging should be viewed as a hobby or side hustle rather than a sustainable career choice.
