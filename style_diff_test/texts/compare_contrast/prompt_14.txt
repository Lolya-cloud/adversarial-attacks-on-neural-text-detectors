Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the two most controversial presidential candidates of the 2016 United States Presidential Election, with vastly differing ideologies, brought about contrasting changes in the country's political arena. Both being the torchbearers of their respective political parties, they had completely different views on policy issues that are important to the country. This essay will compare and contrast the political ideologies, policy stances, and personalities of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have totally divergent political ideologies. Donald Trump, a businessman turned politician, is a member of the Republican Party, which stands for a free-market economy, individual rights, limited government intervention, lower taxes, and religious conservatism. In contrast, Hillary Clinton, a former Secretary of State, and a career politician, is a member of the Democratic Party, which believes in social and economic justice, equal opportunities for everyone and reducing the gap between the rich and poor. Therefore, their ideologies were in direct contradiction with each other, and their respective supporters were polar opposites.

Policy stances were another area with significant differences between the two candidates. Immigration was perhaps the most significant area of difference. Trump believed in building a wall along the United States-Mexico border to put an end to illegal immigration and enact strict policies for legal immigration, whereas Clinton favored a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and less stern policies for legal immigration. Similarly, on the issue of the economy, Trump wanted to stimulate growth by reducing taxes and removing regulations, while Clinton wanted to increase taxes on the wealthy and create a more significant public sector. The divergent policy stances of the candidates played a vital role in their campaigns and shaped the debates of the 2016 Presidential Election.

Personality was also a crucial point of variance between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump was known for his brash and outspoken personality, while Hillary Clinton was typically described as reserved and insular. This personality difference was reflected in their campaign styles. Trump was highly energetic with his rallies, using inflammatory rhetoric to whip up his supporters and criticize his opponents, while Clinton was more straightforward, relied on detailed policies that focused on the day-to-day issues that affected the majority of Americans. Their personalities reflected in their campaigning styles as well, with Clinton relying on facts and details and Trump on emotions.

In conclusion, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton brought about significant contrasts in their political ideologies, policy stances, and personalities. Their divergence ensured an exciting and divisive Presidential Election that saw the highest voter turnout in the last hundred years. Both of them were recognized for different reasons - Trump for his controversial stances and outspoken personality and Clinton for her devotion to detail-oriented policies. With significant differences in thought between the two, it was a clash of ideas that made the Election a spectacle for the ages. The differing policies and campaign styles left an indelible mark on the American electorate and changed the political landscape for the foreseeable future.
